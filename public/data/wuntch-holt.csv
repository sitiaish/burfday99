1,02,02,Wuntch,"Hello, Raymond.",,2
1,02,02,Holt,Captain Wuntch. Good to see you.,,6
1,02,02,Holt,"But if you're here, who's guarding Hades?",insult,7
1,02,02,Wuntch,It's deputy chief Wuntch now. ,,5
1,02,02,Wuntch,"Unsurprisingly, I've been promoted above you. And now I'm here to evaluate you.",insult,13
1,02,02,Holt,What happened to Brandt?,,
2,02,02,Wuntch,"Spot-checks are done. Needless to say, I'm thoroughly underwhelmed.",,9
2,02,02,Holt,"Huh. From your expression, I would've guessed constipated or chilly.",insult,10
2,02,02,Amy,"Excuse me, captain.",,3
3,02,03,Holt,"Street name, giggle pig.",,4
3,02,03,Wuntch,"Hmm, an embarrassing blight growing right under your nose.",,9
3,02,03,Wuntch,Not unlike that moustache you had when we first met.,insult,10
3,02,03,Holt,That moustache was era-appropriate.,,4
4,02,05,Jake,"I would give you more details, but someone just came in to try and find her dalmatian coat.",,18
4,02,05,Wuntch,"Hello, Raymond.",,2
4,02,05,Holt,Madeline.,,1
4,02,05,Holt,I wondered why all the birds had suddenly stopped singing.,insult,10
4,02,05,Holt,What brings you here?,,4
4,02,05,Wuntch,I heard you were under investigation by lnternal Affairs..,,9
4,02,05,Wuntch,Didn't wanna miss that.,insult,4
4,02,05,Holt,So much time with your ear to the pavement. It's a pity a truck hasn't run over your head.,insult,19
4,02,05,Wuntch,Very visual.,,2
4,02,05,Wuntch,"When, oh when, will you quit police work and pursue your dream of poetry?",insult,14
4,02,05,,...,,0
5,02,05,Wuntch,"Oh, Raymond.",,2
5,02,05,Wuntch,An lnternal Affairs investigation? A drug task force that hasn't found any drugs? This precinct's a disaster.,insult,17
5,02,05,Wuntch,Maybe that's why the birds stopped singing. Out of respect for the death of your career.,insult,24
5,02,05,Wuntch,"Good-bye, Raymond.",,2
6,02,05,Jake,"Oh, is that a fact?",,5
6,02,05,Jake,"Because I heard you call deputy chief Wuntch by her first name and after that, you told her you hoped she got carried off by crows.",insult,26
6,02,05,Jake,"That is gross insubordination.",,4
7,02,05,Holt,You're going to leave my precinct and my task force alone. Or else...You're...,,13
7,02,05,Holt,Wuntch meat.,insult,2
7,02,05,Jake,You're sure you wanna go with that one?,,8
8,02,11,Wuntch,Raymond.,,1
8,02,11,Holt,Madeline.,,1
8,02,11,Wuntch,"You won. Go ahead and gloat, you toad.",insult,8
8,02,11,Holt,"Thank you for this honor, deputy chief.",,7
8,02,11,Wuntch,Oh. Okay. You're welcome.,,4
8,02,11,Holt,Wuntch-time is over. Boom! Did it!,insult,6
8,02,11,Holt,Had it both ways.,,4
9,02,14,Holt,"Oh, please stay, Diaz.",,4
9,02,14,Holt,I need a witness in case her head starts spinning around or if she turns into a she-wolf.,insult,18
9,02,14,Wuntch,"Hello, Raymond.",,2
9,02,14,Holt,No flaccid rejoinder? Hmm. What's going on?,,7
9,02,14,Wuntch,I'm here on important business. I'm a frontrunner for a job in the Boston PD.,,15
9,02,14,Holt,"Boston? But it's so close to Salem. You do know what they do to witches up there, don't you?",insult,19
9,02,14,Wuntch,The job is Chief of Police.,,6
9,02,14,Holt,I see. So you've come to brag.,,7
10,02,14,Holt,Just saying it brims my soul with joy.,,8
10,02,14,Holt,But to do so would mean would mean that she stays here in New York City hanging over me like an albino bat.,insult,23
10,02,14,Holt,"On the other hand, if I ""praise"" Wuntch, she will leave this city, the clouds will part, and the children will sing ""Wuntch is gone.""",insult,25
10,02,14,rosa,What children?,,2
10,02,14,Holt,All the children.,insult,3
10,02,14,Rosa,Right. That was a stupid question.,,6
11,02,22,Jake,I meant we have to fight her.,,7
11,02,22,Holt,We're not gonna fight her. She's the devil.,insult,8
11,02,22,Holt,"And you don't dance with the devil, because you get burned.",insult,11
11,02,22,Holt,"Also, because in Madeline's case, she has no rhythm and her hands are like little rat claws.",insult,17
11,02,22,Holt,"If she wants the case, it's hers.",,6
12,02,22,Holt,Wait... Why would you say that?,,6
12,02,22,Holt,And why aren't you clenching your little rat hands in anger?,insult,11
12,02,22,Holt,You didn't want me to fail. You wanted me to succeed.,,10
12,02,22,Wuntch,That's right. I was looking for an excuse to promote you to a desk job!,,15
12,02,22,Wuntch,And you handed it to me on a silver platter with your little rat hands.,insult,15
12,02,22,Holt,Oh no.,,2
13,02,23,Wuntch,So here's how I see this going down.,,8
13,02,23,Wuntch,You plead for your job back. I refuse.,insult,8
13,02,23,Wuntch,You start weeping like a war widow.,insult,7
13,02,23,Wuntch,Does that sound about right?,,5
13,02,23,Holt,"Don't count your gross fish babies before they've hatched, Madeline.",insult,10
13,02,23,Wuntch,How did you get this?,,5
13,02,23,Gina,"Gina and Terry got it, you grackle.",insult,
13,02,23,Holt,It doesn't matter how I got it.,,
13,02,23,Gina,"Sorry, sir, didn't realize that was how you wanted to play it.",,
13,02,23,Wuntch,I see you've got an audience for this little stunt?,,
13,02,23,Holt,"Yes, well, who wouldn't want to see a man fight a crocodile?",insult,
13,02,23,Holt,"Now, Madeline, before one of us starts weeping like a war widow, would you like to give me my precinct back?",insult,
13,02,23,Wuntch,It's not that simple; I can't just reverse your promotion.,,
13,02,23,Holt,"You have until tomorrow, you grackle.",insult,
13,02,23,,...,,
14,03,01,Holt,Wuntch.,,
14,03,01,Wuntch,"Hello, Raymond.",,
14,03,01,Wuntch,You're looking old and sickly.,insult,
14,03,01,Holt,"So nice of you to greet us, Madeline.",,
14,03,01,Holt,I thought surely you'd still be crushed under that house in Munchkinland.,insult,
14,03,01,Wuntch,"Sticks and stones, Raymond.",,
14,03,01,Holt,Describing your breakfast?,insult,
14,03,01,Holt,"I came out as a gay cop in the 1980s, so it's gonna take more than reassigning me to break my spirit.",,
15,03,01,Wuntch,"I like what you've done with your office, Raymond.",,
15,03,01,Wuntch,"It's cozy, like a shoebox one buries a dead hamster in.",insult,
15,03,01,Holt,"So what did you want to see me about?",,
16,03,04,Gina,"Wuntch is here.",,
16,03,04,Wuntch,"Oh, there it is. The shriveled husk of Raymond Holt.",insult,
16,03,04,Holt,"Look, Gina, is that a talking raisin?",insult,
16,03,04,Wuntch,Enough foreplay.,,
17,06,18,Wuntch,"Oh, Raymond, that you came to me to ask for help shows how much you've matured.",,
17,06,18,Wuntch,You know what else shows how much you've matured? Your withered face.,insult,
17,06,18,Holt,"Now I know why you refer to this as a Suicide Squad, Peralta, because I already want to kill myself.",insult,
17,06,18,Wuntch,Why don't you wait a week? You'll probably die of old age.,insult,
17,06,18,Holt,"The only way I'm going to die is if you touch me with one of your bony fingers and drag me across the River Styx, you reaper.",insult,
17,06,18,Jake,"Ah, wonderful. Very creative.",,
18,06,18,Holt,It's probably Madeline.,,
18,06,18,Holt,Cockroaches release a mucus-like secretion.,insult,
18,06,18,Wuntch,"You would know about roaches, you roach.",insult,
18,06,18,Jake,And three!,,
19,06,18,Holt,I don't like this.,,
19,06,18,Holt,"I wouldn't wish working with Madeline Wuntch on my worst enemy, and my worst enemy is Madeline Wuntch, whom I hate.",insult,
19,06,18,Jake,"Look, if you wanna stop Kelly, she's the key to my entire plan.",,
20,06,18,Holt,I will never trust Madeline Wuntch.,,
20,06,18,Holt,"She's a venomous snake waiting to strike, and you know what we do to snakes.",insult,
20,06,18,Rosa,Chop their heads off. Remove the skin. Turn them into boots.,,
20,06,18,Holt,Don't be absurd. Who would want Trollskin boots?,insult,
20,06,18,Rosa,You just said she was a snake.,,
20,06,18,Holt,The devil comes in many forms.,insult,
20,06,18,Holt,"No, what I meant was I want you to follow her and make sure she doesn't betray us.",,
21,06,18,Wuntch,Not possible. Kelly won't tell me anything. He won't even meet with me.,,
21,06,18,Holt,Perhaps you can sneak in disguised as an old leather chair.,insult,
21,06,18,Jake,Will you calm down?,,
22,06,18,Wuntch,My mistake.,,
22,06,18,Wuntch,These two goons were carrying a dirty old mop that looked exactly like you.,insult,
22,06,18,Jake,What did you do?,,
23,06,18,Wuntch,Here's your bug back.,,
23,06,18,Wuntch,"It's not an actual bug, so don't eat it, you lizard.",insult,
23,06,18,Holt,Ha! You didn't specify the subspecies of lizard.,,
24,06,18,Wuntch,They're not allowed to do that.,,
24,06,18,Wuntch,It's against the rules.,,
24,06,18,Holt,"It's also against the rules to let a pile of worms wear a uniform, and yet here you stand.",insult,
24,06,18,Jake,"Okay, just stop.",,
24,06,18,Jake,"Look, sir, I've explained this.",,
24,06,18,Jake,Wuntch is the only one that can get close to Kelly.,,
24,06,18,Jake,We need her.,,
24,06,18,Holt,Okay. The worm pile stays.,insult,
24,06,18,Jake,Great.,,
25,06,18,Wuntch,You must know some moves.,,
25,06,18,Wuntch,You were mentioned by name in the "Monster Mash.",,
25,06,18,Holt,"Fine, but on two conditions. We stay at least 4 inches apart at all times, and you tuck your tail back into your pants so I don't trip on it.",insult,
25,06,18,Wuntch,Deal.,,
26,06,18,Holt,You move well.,,
26,06,18,Holt,"Must be all the extra legs, you crab.",insult,
26,06,18,Wuntch,Don't you find this exhausting?,,
26,06,18,Holt,Thinking of fresh insults?,,
26,06,18,Holt,"Not at all, you coffin cave mold beetle.",insult,
26,06,18,Wuntch,I meant our relationship. Aren't you tired of the rivalry?,,
26,06,18,Wuntch,"We fight and we fight, and nothing changes. But we're really not so different.",,
26,06,18,Holt,I suppose we were close once. Remember Brighton Beach?,,
26,06,18,Wuntch,"1,200 kilos of heroin in an abandoned subway tunnel. How could I forget?",,
26,06,18,Holt,The largest drug bust in NYPD history pulled off by a most unlikely duo.,,
26,06,18,Wuntch,"A woman, and a gay, black detective.",,
26,06,18,Holt,"No, I meant a human and a rotted jack-o'-lantern.",insult,
26,06,18,Wuntch,Don't be so hard on yourself.,,
26,06,18,Wuntch,You weren't all the way rotted back then.,insult,
26,06,18,Wuntch,That's John Kelly.,,
27,06,18,Wuntch,He was smiling at me like an idiot.,,
27,06,18,Holt,"You've betrayed us, you coffin cave mole beetle!",insult,
27,06,18,,...,,
28,07,07,Rosa,Terry said he had some news from the office of Commissioner Wuntch.,,
28,07,07,Holt,What does that human blister want now?,insult,
28,07,07,Holt,Does she intend to demote me even further?,,
28,07,07,Holt,Or perhaps she'll transfer me to the swamps of New Jersey so I can patrol the sinkhole where she was spawned.,insult,
28,07,07,Jake,Or it's possible the announcement has nothing to do with you.,,
28,07,07,Holt,"Oh, good thinking Peralta. You're right.",,
28,07,07,Holt,Maybe Madeline wants to inform us all that she's a Cheuksin.,insult,
28,07,07,Charles,A what?,,
28,07,07,Holt,"A Cheuksin. A Korean toilet ghost, lives in an outhouse, wraps her hair around your throat and chokes you to death while you move your bowels.",,
28,07,07,Jake,"You know what, I will give you $6,000 if the announcement is she's a Cheuksin.",,
28,07,07,Terry,"Okay, everyone. I have some news.",,
28,07,07,Holt,That Madeline Wuntch is a Korean toilet ghost?,insult,
28,07,07,Holt,Boring. We already knew that.,,
28,07,07,Terry,Madeline Wuntch is dead.,,
28,07,07,Holt,Say what now?,,
29,07,07,Holt,No way that's true.,,
29,07,07,Holt,"As Wuntch says when she sees deodorant, I'm not buying it.",insult,
29,07,07,Terry,"Sir, she's dead".,,
29,07,07,Holt,Oh Terry.,,
29,07,07,Holt,"Zombies can't die. This is some sort of scam. If she were dead, we would be hearing the sounds of children singing in the streets.",insult,
29,07,07,Charles,"I don't know sir. You didn't believe it when we told you the Disco Strangler died, either.",,
29,07,07,Holt,And I was right. He was faking it.,,
29,07,07,Charles,Maybe she's alive.,,
29,07,07,Terry,Why would Wuntch fake her own death?,,
29,07,07,Holt,The same reason she visits Mexico once a year and sucks the blood from all the goats.,insult,
29,07,07,Holt,For kicks.,,
30,07,07,,...,,
30,07,07,Holt,"Ding, dong, the Wuntch is dead. Bagels for everyone!",insult,
30,07,07,Rosa,So I guess you believe it now.,,
30,07,07,Holt,Yep. Wanna see the selfies I took?,,
30,07,07,Rosa,"Actually, yes.",,
30,07,07,Amy,Oh my god! I just heard about Wuntch! She was so young!,,
30,07,07,Holt,For a redwood tree.,insult,
30,07,07,Holt,"Uh, I don't understand what's going on. Why are you crying?",,
30,07,07,Amy,I feel sad.,,
30,07,07,Holt,"You don't feel sad when a monster dies in a monster movie. In ""E.T."", do you feel sad when E.T. dies?",insult,
30,07,07,Amy,Yes.,,
31,07,07,Holt,"Well, I know just the thing to cheer you up.",,
31,07,07,Holt,"Wuntch is dead! Bagel! Bagel! Bagel!",insult,
31,07,07,Rosa,"Sir, I am loving this color on you, but don't you think you should tone it down?",,
31,07,07,Holt,"Why, in case I run into her family? I'm not planning any trips to the Bronx Zoo.",insult,
31,07,07,Amy,Wait.,,
32,07,07,Holt,I'm going to play it. Brace yourselves.,,
32,07,07,Holt,"If it shows Madeline, be sure not to look directly into her eyes.",,
32,07,07,rosa,Because we'll turn to stone?,insult,
32,07,07,Holt,"No, because her eyes are ugly.",insult,
32,07,07,Wuntch,"Hello, Raymond. Surprised to see me?",,
32,07,07,Holt,"Well, I didn't say Bloody Mary three times - so yes.",insult,
32,07,07,Amy,"When did she record this?",,
32,07,07,Rosa,"Judging by the flames around her, it could be a livestream.",insult,
32,07,07,Holt,Very good Rosa.,,
33,07,07,Rosa,All you have to do is say a few nice comments during the memorial.,,
33,07,07,Holt,"As God says when Madeline Wuntch tries to sneak past into the gates of Heaven, ""It ain't happening, honey""",insult,
33,07,07,Holt,"I tried to write a kind speech about her last night, and this is what came out.",,
34,07,07,,...,,
34,07,07,Holt,Madeline smelled like dog crap. From a sick dog.,insult,
34,07,07,Holt,Madeline Wuntch will not soon be forgotten. Trick or Treaters will dress like her for generations,insult,
34,07,07,,...,,
35,07,07,Amy,"Well, I think it's natural to feel a little down about her death. For the last 20 years, your lives have been entangled.",,
35,07,07,Holt,Because of her ratty hair.,insult,
35,07,07,Holt,"No, it's not the same. Now it just feels like I'm insulting a helpless dead person.",,
