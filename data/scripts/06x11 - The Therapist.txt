Jakey, I've got a hot case for you.
Ooh, hit me.
Okay, Susan Buckley was reported missing by her psychiatrist, Dr. William Tate.
He thinks that her husband James may have had a mental break and done something terrible to her.
Ooh, that is a hot case.
Missing woman, psycho husband, creepy shrink.
Dr. Tate was actually quite a nice man.
Yeah, but you know, he's a psychiatrist, so he's automatically a creep. I've seen movies.
They all turn into super sophisticated, Chianti-loving cannibals.
Wait, have you never been to therapy?
- No. Don't need it.
- your wife shot you?
What about when you were held at gunpoint and had to write your own suicide note?
Oh, that was crazy. I forgot about that.
Or when you were falsely accused of bank robbery
- and went to prison?
You joined a gang and tried meth!
I didn't want to be anyone's bitch.
Look, it sounds like these things affected you more than they affected me.
I do. Terry needs a safe space to process his emotions.
I go twice a week.
Okay, unlike Kooky Charles and Tearful Terry,
I am healthy and don't need therapy.
I hear that.
Jake and I are like two penises in a pod.
Damn it, Hitchcock, we talked about this.
It never helps when you back me up.
Let's just go, Charles.
- [knock at door]
- How'd you know it was me?
Everyone else in this office plays my door like it's a marimba.
The other day, Jeffords gave it three taps
- and two raps.
- One can only assume.
Anyway, I wanted to invite you and Jocelyn to dinner at my house this weekend.
Kevin will be making his famous rice.
Thank you for the invite, but I'm not really having people meet Jocelyn yet.
I'm still feeling things out with her.
But Boyle says you brought Jocelyn to Shaw's last week.
That was unplanned.
Sure, but now that the squad has all met her, surely you can't object to her having some rice with Kevin and me?
Okay, it's just that you can be a bit... judgmental.
What a stupid thing to say.
Name one time when I have been judgmental.
- Okay.
Oh, I see. Mere seconds ago.
Sir, Jocelyn is not like us.
- She has feelings.
Are you positive this is the woman for you?
That is exactly the type of thing I don't want you to say in front of her.
Sorry. It's not gonna happen.
[footsteps departing]
Kevin, they're not coming.
Yes, I know you've already started soaking the rice.
Couldn't we just eat it ourselves?
I understand you purchased four portions of rice.
Yes, that's a great idea.
We'll eat the extra rice for breakfast.
I love you, as well.
Hey, Sarge, a package was delivered to my desk downstairs, addressed to the   th Precinct, attention: Sergeant, but it's not for me.
It's a book.
Sounds like something you'd order.
"How to Please Your Wife:    Tips to Take Your s*x Life from Blah to Ahhhh."
Yeah. That's not mine.
It also shipped with two gallons of protein powder.
Well, I get my protein from real food.
meals a day,   every    minutes.
It's not a big deal, okay?
I promise I won't tell anyone.
Hey, Sarge, I heard you need some s*x tips.
Except for the people I already told.
Here's the big one: just lie flat on your back.
- Women love to do all the work.
That's very incorrect, and I don't need s*x tips!
Okay, we'll just leave the book here, and whoever did order it can take it when nobody's looking.
It's not mine!
Terry doesn't order books online.
He supports local bookstores.
They're dying, Amy!
Oh, that guy looks like he's wearing a skin mask over his own face, so I'm guessing it's Dr. Tate.
He has a normal man's face, Jake.
Yes, he does have a normal man's face, stretched out over his own face, because he is a Hannibal.
Hi there. Dr. Tate, I presume.
Yes. Hi, nice to meet you.
Uh, which one of you is in charge?
- Let the mind games begin.
Sorry, I am Detective Peralta.
This is Detective Boyle. He's in charge.
Dr. Tate, have you heard anything from Mrs. Buckley?
No, I haven't, and I'm quite worried.
I received a frantic, disturbing call from James yesterday.
He was afraid he'd done something horrible.
I asked him where he was, and he said he was in the park near the Zen garden.
I suspected he was just experiencing delusions, but when they didn't show up for therapy today, I became very concerned.
So you think he killed her and dumped her body in the park?
Sounds like couples counseling is going really great for them.
Sorry, my partner doesn't believe in therapy.
Oh, that's fine.
Title of your s*x tape. [exclaims]
Are you normally so cavalier around murder investigations?
Yes, we see a lot of darkness in our line of work, and humor is one of our coping mechanisms.
It's self-preservation through disassociation.
What the [bleep]?
It's something I've been working on with my therapist.
Well, I act like this because I'm cool and fun and people like being around me.
I'm so sorry.
Okay, Doc, you're not in your office.
You don't have to use words like "triggered" or "in denial."
I didn't say "in denial."
No, I am not, and before you say anything,
I don't want to sleep with my mom either.
Now, why would you bring that up unprompted?
What? You prompted it.
Jake, there's a body over here.
Oh, thank God.
I mean, "Oh, no, death."
I mean... I don't want to sleep with my mom, okay?
I know this is the wrong takeaway from this case board, but I really love the new yarn you're using.
- There are sparkles in it.
Okay, so let's go over what we got.
No witnesses, no weapon.
No conclusive DNA found at the scene other than from the three of us who found the body.
And our chief suspect, James Buckley, has disappeared.
But he has no motive, no criminal record, and according to his credit card statement, had just purchased two sombreros.
Kind of weird to give someone a sombrero when you're about to murder them.
Well, both sombreros could have been for him.
It's always good to have a backup sombrero.
Please stop pronouncing it like that.
What, pronouncing sombreros
- like sombrero?
[Spanish accent] Fine, if you want me to pronounce it the wrong way.
Look, I think James is a good suspect.
We have Dr. Tate's notebooks, and they specifically mention that he's been having violent fantasies for the last few months.
And you want us to just blindly trust Dr. Tate?
He's a creepy therapist. They all are.
What kind of profession requires a couch?
Lots of them. My cousin Pam has a couch in his bird store.
Yes! Decidedly so.
You always get upset when I bring up Pam.
Whatever. Can we please just go check out James's apartment?
Mm-hmm.

Hello, gentlemen. How is your day going?
Great. I just woke up from my morning nap.
[stammers] I mean, my... morning nap.
It's fine.
Okay. Are you trying to prove that you can be nonjudgmental?
Rosa, I didn't see you there.
I was just having a friendly chat with my employees.
So, uh, boys, tell me, what are you doing this weekend?
Well, we're going to a sauce launch party at Wing Slutz.
Sounds like a neat cultural event.
They're introducing a new dairy-based sauce called Cream Dream.
Mmm.
And everyone who comes gets a free bucket.
You want to know what that's called?
- Of course I do.
None of us do. You proved your point.
If you want to meet Jocelyn so bad, you can.
You win.
Okay, well, that's Friday night.
Now, every Saturday morning, we go to the public baths.
I get it. You lead colorful lives.
Let's end this, shall we?
Okay, so the neighbors say they haven't seen or heard any activity in the Buckleys' apartment, and...
What is he doing here?
If we find James and he's unstable, Dr. Tate could talk him down.
- Hello, Peralta.
- he gave me a quickie.
A quick therapy session.
Did you know that I have a tendency
- to be unconsciously sexual?
It's a real tough nut to bust.
Oh, you're doing it again.
Oh, okay, I think I hear it.

Whatever, let's just do this, okay?
NYPD, open up.

Terry, come on.
Nobody cares about your s*x life.
Just take the book home.

Take someone else's book home?
That's stealing and mail fraud.
I can't believe you would even suggest that.
Look, I think it's so great that you've been married so long and want to keep it fresh.
I hope Jake does that for me if our s*x life ever takes a dip.
Dip? Oh, there is no dip.
- Just ask Sharon.
I don't want to do that.

Yeah, could you tell Amy how good I am in bed?
Because I'm a s*x machine who...
Oh, on speaker?
Oh, hey, girls. How was school?
Why do you think
He already knew where the bathroom was.
He's clearly been here before.
Well, he probably just guessed, because it's obvious.
This is New York.
It's never obvious where the bathroom is.
I once had an apartment where the toilet was literally in the refrigerator.
I bet he was sleeping with Susan.
Therapists are always having affairs with their patients.
- That's not true.
Tell that to the ten minutes of "Bikini Shrink"
I watched on Cinemax when I was   .
Dr. Juggs was insatiable.
James was ill. We have months of notes saying he was increasingly unstable.
First of all, people with mental illness are much more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators.
I heard that on NPR when I was in the room
- while Amy was listening to NPR.
And second, I bet Dr. Tate's notes are fake.
I mean, you know what
- What?
- What does that prove?
All I'm saying is, something feels suspicious to me here.
Maybe we should go to Dr. Tate's office and see if we can find the missing notebooks.
Wait, you're basing this all on the fact that he knew where a bathroom was?
And his DNA was at the scene where we discovered the body.
[gasps] I bet that's why he insisted on coming with us to the park.
You've been weird about Dr. Tate from the start.
To me, the evidence suggests that James killed his wife and fled.
It's my case, and that's the lead we're following.
Okay.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I was being unfair. It's your case.
You call in an APB, and I will meet you back at the precinct.
I'm just gonna swing by the bank.
You're not gonna go to Dr. Tate's office and search it behind my back, are you?
What? Charles, no.
I wouldn't do that. You can trust me.
- Okay, I trust you.
- Well, I do.
- I feel good about it.
I think it's the right choice.
You're making the right call by trusting me.
Not.
"Wayne's World." Sweet.

All right, think.
Where would I hide the real notebook if I was a creepy therapist?
In my butt. [chuckles]
Focus, Jake.
Now is not the time for being hilarious.

What have we here?
James and Susan Buckley.
[voices in hallway]
So your day's been going well?
- It has, it has.
A cancellation, and so I was able to get more work done.
Yeah. Well, that's always nice.
Same thing happened to me yesterday.
- Is that right?
You know? At least it wasn't three.

- You too.
See you in the morning.
Oh, um, can I help you?
Yes.
I am... your new patient.

You're an hour and a half early.
I know. I have problems with time management.
That's the issue I want to talk about.
On the phone, you said you were concerned you might have multiple personality disorder.
Yep, that too.
Got buttloads of peeps living in my brain, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt.
We should talk about it.
I can't believe it's taken so long for us to meet.
You're so nice.
Oh, I don't know about that, Jocelyn.
I'm just being myself.
Well, you're very sweet about the cosmetology thing.
A lot of people are dismissive of hairstylists.
It makes no sense.
If we didn't have hairstylists to cut our hair, our hair would be far too long.

Hey, you're the girl from the diarrhea commercial, aren't you?
You get diarrhea on the plane.

Are you... an actor?
Well, you don't have to sound so grossed out.
I can see why you didn't want him meeting Jocelyn.

It's Sheena. She's an actress.
Yeah, I was in an episode of "SVU."
I say, "We want answers."
The director tried to replace me, but Mariska said it would take too much time, and then they all agreed I'd probably cut together fine.
Look, Diaz, I've obviously misread our relationship.
You didn't want me to meet the real Jocelyn because we're not as close as I thought we were, so... message received.
Hey, so you don't by any chance need any molly, do you?

Now I'm out of character, and I don't sell any drugs.
I am leaving.
So, Garrett, where would you like to begin?
You know what, can we crack the door a little?
I get very claustrophobic, probably from all the different people living in my head.
We usually keep it closed for privacy, but whatever makes you comfortable.
Thank you.
Damn it, he's still here.

Fine, you want something real?

When I was a kid, I was acting out at school, so they made me and my parents do family counseling, but instead of helping me with my problems, the stupid therapist just brought up all my parents' issues.
