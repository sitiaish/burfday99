I called you here to discuss where we are with Operation 225641441636324.
What?
I assigned a numerical value to each letter in the word "pimento," which I then squared.
Oh, Captain.
How dare you try and sneak math into this?
Peralta.
Update us on Santiago's undercover prison operation.
Yeah, she has made contact with Jimmy Figgis' sister, but it's slowgoing.
I hope she comes back soon.
Aww. You miss her?
No, I lost the key to her apartment, and I'm taking care of her fish.
They're all dead already, aren't they?
Yeah.
Damn it.
Our priority is still finding Figgis' agent in the FBI.
I think it's time for me to call in a favor from an old colleague at the bureau, Bob Anderson.
I would've contacted him sooner, but this is a rogue op, and he's a real stickler for the rules.
He once picked up a penny off the street, which he then reported on his taxes.
Sounds like a barrel of laughs.
Fortunately, he isn't.
We worked together back in the day and really hit it off.
[radio static]
We're going to be here a while.
Would you like to talk?
I'd rather not.
Agreed.

Oh, man.
A secret FBI meet up?
I love this!
Look at all those idiots.
They have no idea what's about to go down.
You mean that woman and her baby?
Yep. Idiots.
Oh, here comes Bob.
Please behave.
Hello, Bob.
Good to see you.
And you. Apologies.
It's inappropriate for me to partake in such informal conversation in front of your detectives.
It's all right. I am equally to blame.
Oh, my God.
There's two of them.
So, Raymond, what evidence do you have that there's a dirty agent in the FBI?
Let's see the file.
We don't have a file.
You're working file-less?
We saw the guy commit a felony.
He tried to have a cop killed.
Crazy hot cop.
Well, he's a specific type.
Look, the guy we're looking for was wearing a ski mask, but he's about 5'10". Caucasian.
He's got a big scar on his right hand.
We've been calling him ScarJo, like the actress, Scarlett Johansson.
What? An actress?
I didn't know that was where that was from.
Bob, I'm so sorry.
No, I'll look past it.
Okay.
There's an agent that matches that description.
His name is Ryan Whealon.
You think you could ID him if you saw him?
Oh, yeah. I'd recognize that scar from 20 miles away.
You must have fantastic vision.
Or it's a gigantic scar.
I was clearly exaggerating.
Why do you have to ruin everything?
[funky music]
Dr. Schwartz, I'm here for my appointment.
Hello, Cortez. Shabbat Shalom.
"Shabbat Shalom"?
I don't know. Jake made me Jewish.
So how are things going with Maura?
Well, I'm part of her crew, but she still won't talk about her past.
[radio static]
So, what kind of stuff did you used to do in New York?
What's with all the questions, Regis?
Actually, it's Michael Strahan now.
What?
[radio static]
She's so scary.
I saw her pull her own tooth out and throw it into a woman's eye.
Yeah, that's bad. So guess what.
Genevieve just texted.
We're gonna hear about our adoption any minute.
I thought you were doing fertility treatments.
We are, but it's not going well.
The doctor said my sterility is so aggressive, it may have spread to her.
Okay.
But, adoption! Charles, that's amazing!
I know!
Oh, no.
What?
Maura.
[both clearing throats]
Anyway, Ms. Cortez, your v*g1n* looks great.
Mazel.

Did you see this morning's newspaper?
No. I get all my news from a text message chain with my friends.
[gasps] The attorney general might step down!
I'm kidding. It's a GIF of a rabbit eating spaghetti.
There's an article about the Nine-Nine's monthly crime rate.
Those numbers aren't supposed to be public until next week.
Terry, you're gonna have to be more interesting if you want to get an "oh, dang."
There's a leak in the Nine-Nine!
Oh, dang.
I presented those numbers in a morning briefing, but I can't imagine anyone would be stupid enough to leak 'em.
Really, Terrence? Look how dumb they are.
Ugh!
D'aww!
Printer's fixed.
Oh, dang.

Tell Peralta Whealon's approaching.
Here comes the douche bag.
Gray suit. Act natural.

Wow, look at that. What a great magazine.
Sir, if you're interested, the new issue of "Clown Boobies" just came in. I can unpack the box for you.
What?
Oh. Haha.
Actually, no. I need last month's.
There's a particular clown... booby... that I'm looking for.
What is Peralta doing?
He appears to be rifling through "Clown Boobies Magazine."
Whoa!
Stupid butterfingers.
It's all right.
Thank you.
Here you go.
[radio static]
Thank you. Thank you so, so much.
Not thank you. Not thank you at all, you dirtbag.
Hey, Cortez!
What's going on with you and that doctor?
You seem real tight with him.
No, we're not tight. I barely know him.
So why were you hugging him?
My last appeal got denied, so he was comforting me.
He's a sensitive guy. Maybe because of his Jewish faith.
I want to talk to him. Alone.
Oh. About something medical? Or...
What did I tell you about asking too many questions?
Right. That's that thing you killed a bunch of bitches for.
[quietly] Ah. Got it. Sorry.
We've been watching this guy all day.
Can't believe we haven't even arrested him yet.
We know he's the guy.
We have to build a case first.
4:13 p.m. Subject finishes his coffee. Or tea.
Mark the beverage as "unknown."
Detectives.
What does the FBI database tell us about Whealon and Figgis?
Both of their files were completely wiped.
I've never seen that before.
Yeah, that's because he's guilty, and we're just sitting here watching him eat a peach.
That's a nectarine.
It's either a nectarine or a peach.
Just write "unknown stone fruit."
There can't just be digital files.
There must be hard copies.
Those are all under lock and key in the archives.
If I asked for clearance, they could alert him.
Interesting.
So what you're saying is our only option is to break into the FBI and steal the file.
Don't be absurd.
Bob, I apologize for the absurdity.
I see no absurdity.
Actually, I think Peralta's right.
Let's plan a heist.
Bob?
Blueprints for the New York Headquarters of the FBI.
The file we're looking for is in the archive room, here, in the basement.
We will be represented by these things I had in my pocket.
All I had was lint. Just a pocketful of lint.
Everybody remember what your lint looks like.
My lint is round.
My lint is approximately 1 centimeter in diameter.
My lint is blue.
My lint is oblong.
My lint is approximately 1/2 centimeter in length.
My lint is also blue.
Wow, so no pushback on the lint thing? This is great.
Now, I can give you clearance to get in the front door, but getting into the archive is another matter.
If I go into this bathroom, I could climb through this vent, drop down into the archive room, and steal the file.
How are you gonna get out?
Pull myself back up the way I came in.
What? I can do a pull-up. Terry will teach me.
This whole area is video-monitored by this guard here.
I can distract him with conversation.
What do you know about him?
Watches a lot of TV.
I heard him mention "s*x and the City."
Then I will discuss both of those shows with him.
Ooh. "s*x and the City" is one show.
It's not a show called "s*x" and then another show called "The City."
Okay. Good start.
Now I know that.
Oh.
I can disable the security DVRs, but I need some way of getting to a station unnoticed.
I have an idea on how to smuggle you in, but it'll be a tight fit.
I'm flexible. I do a lot of yoga.
You do yoga?
Helps keep me centered. If you ask me about it again, I'll hunt you down and rip your face off.
Okay. Great. Good plan. I won't ask you about it again.
I got the DVRs.
Actually, that's my lint. My lint is oblong.
My lint is blue.
Okay! Sounds like we've got a plan. Let's get to training.
[Charles exhales heavily]
Why does she want to meet with me? You think our cover's blown?
I don't know, but, just to be safe, let's review your backstory.
I went to Yeshiva med school, residency at Mount Sinai, my best friend is Yacob Peralberg, and we share everything with each other.
Can't imagine that last part coming up, but okay.
[door opens]
You got this.
[both clearing throats]
Well, Isabel, your baby's head is the perfect size.
Oh, thank you, doctor.
Still gonna hurt when it comes out. Get ready for that.
So you're Dr. Schwartz.
That's me. L'chaim. How can I help you?
I've been watching you ever since you showed up here.
You don't seem like the other doctors that we've had.
It's funny... my best friend, Yacob, is always saying that.
Oh.
Cut the crap.
We both know why I'm here.
We do?
Your heart's beating a mile a minute.
It's not because I'm nervous!
Cortez says that you're sensitive. I like that.
I've only been with cheating scum.
Oh.
Until now.
Ahh!

Yeah.
We're all good.
He was just checking me out.
Mm-hmm.
And I will see you soon, doctor?
Mm-hmm.
Later.
Yeah. Later.
[door closes]
Curse this perfect butt.
How dare you, sir?
Do you really think we would leak information on purpose?
No. We think you're dum-dums and you did it by accident.
Oh. Well, that's very possible.
Yeah, I could see that.
The briefing was a week ago.
Just tell us everyone you talked to since then.
Well, let's see. On Saturday, I got together with my friends, and we went to the dog track.
We need names.
I lied. There's not multiple friends.
It's just Scully.
Okay. What about you, Scully?
Well, I went to the Knicks game with a buddy.
Was this "buddy" named Hitchcock?
Yes, and we weren't at the game.
We were at the dog track.
Oh, come on, guys.
Is there anyone you could've told the crime stats to?
Crime stats?
Wait. Do either of you even know what our arrest numbers were?
12.
No!
Then no.
Yeah, they're not the leak.

Well, I'm actually a combination of all four characters.
Both: Five if you count the city of New York.
Yes.
[chuckles]
Another Sex-and-the-Citiot?
Guilty as charged.
My favorite season has to be the third one.
Everything was going right for Carrie.
Her face was on every bus, her column was the talk of the town, and she met everyone's favorite furniture maker, Aidan Shaw.
Sure, she melted down when he tried to introduce her to his parents, and she flipped out when she bumped into Big getting out of that cab with Natasha, whom he had married.
Hmm. Who can blame her?
They barely knew each other.
The best episode that year... was episode six, entitled "Are We Sluts?"
You know the one. Carrie was all in her head because she and Aidan weren't having s*x.
Meanwhile, across town, Charlotte couldn't stop having s*x.
And Samantha? Samantha was just being Samantha.
The season finale that year was entitled "Cock-a-Doodle-Do."
Cock-a-doodle-doo. Roger that.

Whoops.
I hate Big!
Carrie should've ended up with Mikhail Baryshnikov.

It might've just been that the reporter was really good at his job, like that hot blond surfer was at TMZ?
Maybe you leaked it.

Now is the time for groin-stomping.

Wait a minute. He's got a pulse.
No, wait. That's my pulse.
No. It's his pulse. Nope, it's both our pulses.
He's alive! I'm alive! We're all alive!
This case just got busted wide open.
Good news.
The doctors say Whealon's not gonna die.
Thank God. I just hope he's in a lot of pain.
They say he'll be out of the coma within 12 hours.
Great. That means he'll definitely testify against Figgis, and you know what that means: time for celebration candy bars!
Stupid hospital vending machines didn't have alcohol for some weird reason. Here.
Why not? I really have embraced my wild side today.

He followed me, and you know I'm a proud member of team follow-back.
So I went through your feed to see what you were posting.
Lot of pictures of your kids. Nobody cares.
And then I found this picture you posted last week.
