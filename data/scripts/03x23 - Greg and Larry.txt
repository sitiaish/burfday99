Come on, come on, Captain, pick up.
Your friend Bob is secretly working for Jimmy "the Butcher" Figgis.
This is a call you're gonna want to take.
Bob must've done something to him.
Or maybe they're talking about something super boring, like potatoes or beans.
White rice, brown rice... those are just some of the rices I love.
Mmm.
Also basmati.
Mmm.
Uh, that's all of them now.
I should've known Agent Whealon was dirty.
There were signs.
He wore a V-neck once.
Bob.
You did nothing?
It's my greatest regret.
Well, at least he's still alive.
When he comes out of the coma, we'll get him to talk.
Would you mind getting us some food?
I can't fathom eating these candies that Peralta bought us.
Chocolate is the devil's carob.
And carob is Satan's raisin.
I'll go down to the cafeteria, see if I can't scare up some untoasted bread.
Yum.
Oh, Raymond.
I forgot my wallet in my...
Bob, you've killed him.
And now I'm going to have to kill you.
I've never been more shocked.
♪ ♪
This is bad. This is really bad.
Where would Bob have taken Holt?
I don't know, the library?
Or an index card factory?
Is there such a thing as an accounting museum?
I...
Hold on. I got this.
I know the captain's "find my phone" password.
He's at the hospital.
He's still at the hospital. You're a genius!
Well, I'd love to take credit, but the truth is, life just isn't that hard.
We got to get to the hospital, and we got to get there fast.
Then I should drive.
Why you?
I have nothing to live for, and I drive like it.
Okay, let's do it.
[all screaming, siren wailing]
[car horn honking]
Jake called.
We need to get back to New York right now.
No, no, no, no, no.
You can't just leave.
We may need some of those contacts in the future.
You're gonna go say good-bye, and you're gonna mean it.
So while I'm happy the Supreme Court threw out my conviction, I'm also really sad to be leaving all of you.
Bethany, I know you're an arsonist, but now it's time to set the culinary world on fire.
Sheila, you have the voice of an angel.
Whoever your next music producer is, maybe don't stab him.
Jen, you're a Nazi. We never really clicked.
Stay innocent, ladies.

No, no, no. What happened?
He flatlined 20 minutes ago.
The two men who were in this room, where did they go?
I don't know.
[cell phone dings]
Okay, thanks.
Gina said Holt is still in the building.
But where?
I have to get into their heads.
Whew.
"Bob, what are you doing?"
"I'm breaking the law, Raymond, because I'm the worst. Now walk out of this room as if nothing is happening."
"You'll never get away with this, Bob. Jake is on his way. He's a great cop, and he's going to save me."
"Really? He seemed so immature."
"Yes, he seems that way, but I know the real Jake. He's like a son to me. And when this is all through, we're going on a road trip together."
Jake.
Rosa, shh!
I'm working on the case right now.
[snorts] That's weird.
There's a smudge on this sign right over the H.
There's a smudge on this H too.
Oh, my God, why would you touch a hospital thing and then put it in your mouth?
It's chocolate.
Great instincts. Never doubt yourself.
Holt is trying to send us a message using the candy bar I gave him.
Just act natural, Raymond.
Eat your candy bar.
I can't. It's disgusting.
I don't care.
[tense music]
[sighs]
H is for Holt.
He's leading us right to him.
Now all we have to do is follow the trail of chocolate.
This... this is why I became a cop.
[sighs] Charles, what took so long?
I want to get out of this suit before we take off.
We're not going anywhere.
The flight is booked, and there's already a huge stand-by line.
What? We have to get on that plane.
Were you stern?
Amy, you know I wasn't.
[sighs] I've got this.
Holt's in danger, and that lady's in my way.
Never get between a teacher's pet and her teacher.
Ooh.
Okay, vest lady.
I don't care what you have to do...
Oh, you sweet thing, you're pregnant.
So pregnant.
What a miracle, right?
Oh.
Please give me special treatment.
I ripped her a new one, and guess what fell out.
Two tickets to New York.
Ugh.
First class upgrade.
Ahh.

No chocolate smudges in this entire parking garage.
Or on floors one through five.
We're officially lost the trail.
Unless...
No, that's not chocolate.
What is that?
What?
Don't eat it again!
[cell phone dings]
Wait, getting a text.
It's Captain Holt.
Where is he?
What'd he say?
"Inib rue tiid."
Wait, I'm getting another one.
"Ink obrvs whiz." These are nonsense.
He's been gagged.
How would that come through in a text, Scully?
Wait a minute. I know what's going on.
He's secretly trying to text us from his pocket.
When I die, please give Kevin my regards.
What shall I tell him?
"Regards."
Scully, these look like the weird texts you always send.
Touch screen phones don't respond correctly to my fingers.
It's because I've been electrocuted so many times.
Hold on, I bet we can reverse engineer this thing.
Scully, type this into your phone.
"Inib rue tiid." Two "I"s.
It came out, "Imm on rha rooj."
"I'm on the roof." He's on the roof!
Oh, God bless you, Scully, and your weird, dead hands.
You and Hitchcock are killing it!
[both chuckle]
[grunts]
Oh, my God.
Let's just go.
Freeze! Drop your weapon!
One more step, and I kill your captain.
Come on, Bob. What are you doing up here?
Why are you on the roof?
Oh, my God.
You're gonna zip-line off of this thing like an American ninja.
That is such a cool escape plan.
Actually, I was gonna throw Raymond over the side and make it look like a bird-watching accident.
Oh, please, do you think anyone's gonna actually...
It's genius.
There's a red-tailed hawk roost a block away, and I've got a pair of micro binoculars in my pocket, like a fool.
Okay, well, I stand corrected.
Just drop the gun and surrender.
If you turn on Figgis, this doesn't have to end badly for you.
You still have that file with all the evidence against him?
You mean the one you handed me?
That was a good idea at the time; we all thought that.
Yes, that file's in a safe place, and you're never getting it.
Don't be foolish, Bob. You're outnumbered.
Outnumbered, my bottom.
Figgis's men are on the way.
Yes, I called for backup.
Captain, down!
[both grunt]
Oh-ho, Terry took you down!
Nice timing, Sarge.
How'd you know we were up here?
Captain marked the Hs in chocolate, which I instantly connected to the giant helipad H we're on right now.
Oh. Cool.
Cool, yes, we also solved that.
Came straight up here to the roof.
We didn't wander around even for a second.
We're all smart.
Smart. This is a good hiding space.
Scully, why are you lying down?
'Cause there was a bed here.
You took your shoes off.
All right, look, a bunch of sketchy, black SUVs just pulled up outside.
Either it's Figgis's guys, or Beyoncé stubbed her toe.
Don't even joke about that, Jake.
That would be our new number one priority.
We have to call for backup.
Figgis has people in the NYPD and the FBI.
So good luck with that.
Wow, betraying the FBI is one thing, but sarcasm, Bob?
Wow.
All right, we're on our own.
We got to get Bob out of this hospital and to a secure location, someplace the NYPD doesn't know about.
Captain, you're a grown-up; let's just use your lake house.
For the last time, not all grown-ups have lake houses.
We can go to my apartment.
No one knows where I live.
I thought you had Amy over there once.
Yeah, it was fun. I moved the next day.
Rosa's place it is.
Well, they know what Bob looks like, but they've never seen us.
They think we're just a big group of cops.
What if we didn't look like cops?

Great, everyone looks fantastic, and our hats look normal.
Wow, Sarge, you are just stuffed into those scrubs.
How do you do it?
Exercise and diet. It's not that hard.
Eh, seems pretty hard to me.
I don't think I'm gonna do that.
This brings back memories.
I loved playing doctor as a child.
The cancer has spread.
Get your house in order.
So we can sneak out like this, but what about Bob?
Not to worry. I've got that covered.
Hitchcock.
[mumbling]
And, yes, he is bound and gagged under there, but more importantly, you said, "What about Bob?"
That's the name of a movie.
Holt made a pop culture reference.
All right, let's go.
Okay, let's go over our exit strategy one more time.
Seat 2A is gonna need help with her bags.
She has twig arms.
So if she blocks us, I play the pregnancy card.
And remember, leave our luggage and...
Roll the dice with lost and found.
I know; I've been studying this map you drew on the barf bag for 40 minutes.
Sorry, working is the only thing keeping me from worrying about the squad and completely spiraling.
Hot towels?
For the billionth time, no!
We don't want your boiled rags!
[whispering] No, thank you.
I don't know if it's keeping you from spiraling.
Look, why don't we just take our mind off everything?
We're in first class. We get free movies.
What? No.
We can't enjoy ourselves while the squad is in danger.
That's not fair.
Amy, we're trapped here for three hours.
There's nothing else we can do.
Fine, I'll watch a movie, but nothing we'll like too much.
No new releases.
Of course not.
We'll just put on whatever's first alphabetically.

Get me an ICP catheter, stat!
Wow, that was amazing, Sarge.
