Thank you for joining me for what promises to be the diggity-dopest tree lighting in the history of the Nine-Nine.
I don't understand. Where's the tree?
It was inside us all along. Brilliant, Jake.
No, Charles, not everything was inside of us all along.
The tree is right here.
Cool. Can we go now?
Obviously not. Behold, the greatest inflatable tree that 'Murica has to offer.
And now, in the immortal words of Saint Nick, turn on the compressor.
[GRUNTS]
[WHIRRING]
You hear that? It's the sound of Christmas.
It's deafening.
It's getting really big.
What size tree did you get?
It's a jumbo.
It says it's ten meters tall.
That's...
Roughly 32.81 feet.
Someone unplug it, unplug it now.
We can't. It swallowed its own plug!
Everybody run!
[ALL EXCLAIMING]
Okay, the tree has been contained.
Wait, we left a man behind.

Ah, the Boyles are here. Good tidings.
Genevieve, hello, you're looking...
Sexy as a minx.
I was gonna say "festive," due to the scarf.
The bra underneath is insane.
It is.
Okay.
Parenthood has not changed you two.
Hey there, Nikolaj, my man.
How you doing?
Hi, Jake, we made Daddy Latvian Christmas cookies. Want one?
You bet I do.
The potato really brings out the vinegar.
Neither of those are cookie things. I'm just gonna put that back.
So, you excited for Christmas, bud?
Yeah, I'm so excited.
This is Nikolaj's first Christmas because the orphanage kept cancelling it.
Once it was blizzards, one it was fires, and once it was...
Famine.
That's right, famine.
Oh.
Papa promised me The best present ever: a Captain Latvia action figure!
Whoa, Captain Latvia? What's his superpower?
Can he talk to moose?
No, possums.
Worse.
It's a very difficult toy to get in America, so I was worried when Charles told Nikolaj he would get him one.
I said, keep it a surprise, so you don't build up his expectations, but Charles said, "No way, I want to build expectations."
Well, we all remember the conversation. Well, work time for Daddy.
I'll see you guys later. Okay, I love you guys so much.
Love you.
All right.
Bye.
Christmas is gonna be amazing!
Christmas is gonna suck. I don't have the present.
What? But you promised Nikolaj.
I ordered it a month ago from a Latvian toy store, and it still hasn't arrived yet.
The shipping company is giving me the runaround.
All right, so just get him a different present, like a Jet Ski or... a hammer.
I don't know what kids are into.
Genevieve and I worked so hard to get Nikolaj to trust us when we brought him home.
[SIGHS] That's gonna be destroyed, the way dry rot destroyed his orphanage.
Trust me, it's gonna be fine.

Apparently, the Gals Skepu are major gun-runners on the east coast. Their leader's got an office in the back. Also, great chest hair.

Okay. Come on in.
Oh, laughing is fun.
The question on the table is, do we add a velvet-voiced drunkard to our caroling group, or do we lose miserably like a bunch of miserable losers?
I say we do it, and I'm the boss.
Therefore, meeting adjourned.
I can't believe you're even considering this, Captain.
The guy's a criminal.
Barely. It was public intoxication.
All he did was pee on a couple snowmen.
And one regular man.
Plus, it'll count toward his community service.
In a certain way, we'll be furthering the cause of justice.

Eyes up here, Jake. So, did you learn anything, or were you just staring at my body the whole time?
Weird, but I did find out who the manager is, and I'm almost positive she's got a key to the back office on her right now.
Her name is Svetlana.
Thanks. I'll take it from here.
Wait, Charles, she doesn't speak any English, and we don't wanna blow our cover.
