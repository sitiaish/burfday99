Are you ready for this one?
Dotties' daughter Anne's getting divorced.
Hate to say "I told you so," but I told you so.
You know, we should fix her up with Bernice's son.
What's his name? The doctor.
Oh, Vince.
And he's not a doctor. He's a pharmacist.
Although that might appeal to Anne.
Paw-paw-paw.
[all laughing]
Greg, you are such a crack-up.
Forget Anne... who should we fix him up with, huh?
Oh, now, Stella, you know I'm still getting over the tragic loss of my wife.
She was such a strong, female woman with nice, heavy breasts.
Who's that?
Oh, that's my neighbor. Hey, Larry.
Oh, hey...
Greb.
Greg.
Ah, that was it.
I'm not sure why I have so much trouble remembering... probably 'cause our relationship is so casual.
Morning, ladies.
Hi.
Uh, do a lap without me.
I need to talk to Larry about an issue with our shared fence.
Larry, I need to talk to you about an issue with our shared fence.
Yes, I also need to discuss this shared fence issue with you.
Okay, they're out of earshot.
Why are you up so early?
No reason... just excited to face a new day.
Oh, because ever since we've been down here, you've been a little depressed.
Have I?
[crying]
No, no, no, don't eat the burrito.
[moaning]
[sobbing] Oh, I'm disgusting.
Okay, fine, I may have had a teensy bit of trouble adjusting when we first got here for, like, six teensy, little months, but I took your advice, and I got a job.
Doing what?
I sell ATVs now, eh?
Well, the truth is, these little babies sell themselves.
They're super fun, and they're a lot safer than you might think... if you're standing next to one.
If you're driving it, it's actually much more dangerous than you could possibly imagine.
Well, a job is good.
I know being stuck down here in Florida isn't ideal, but we need to make the best of it.
In fact, I'm applying for a promotion at my new job.
Ah, very "noice."
And if all goes well, tonight you might be neighbors with Greg Stickney, Assistant Manager.
Very double "noice."
Well, I'm off to work. [clears throat]
Might want to stand back.
You're kind of in the blast zone here.
Don't want to forget the strap.

You had the idea to install sinks in the bathrooms.

Greg, where did you go to college?
Ohio State, where I majored in... communications.
Perfect.
Larry, what's your favorite movie?
Uh, "Die Hard."
Wrong.
Jake's favorite movie is "Die Hard."
I asked you for Larry's favorite movie.
Two people can have the same favorite movie.
They can, but they don't.
Larry's favorite movie is "Failure to Launch."

Moving on, three weeks ago an informant told the FBI where to find Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis.
Acting on that lead, 50 federal agents and I raided a warehouse in Paramus.
It was awesome.
So you got him... it's over. We can go home?
No, sorry.
Figgis wasn't there.
The raid was awesome.
Caught up with a lot of dudes I don't normally get to see.
Do you know what happened to Figgis?
No, but what we do know is that Figgis was never there.
Our Intel was wrong from minute one.
Is there any way we could help with the investigation?
No, absolutely not.
Your involvement would endanger your lives and this case.
[sighs]
I'm sorry, but it looks like Larry and Greg will be in Florida indefinitely.
Pop quiz, Larry: who's the female lead in "Failure to Launch"?
Kate Hudson?
Sarah Jessica Parker, man!
God, it's like you want to die.

So we're in Florida indefinitely.
You okay?

Poor choice of words, but the sentiment remains.

It's the job. It keeps me focused.

Yep.

I was already suspicious about your new positive attitude towards Florida, a state you once described as "America's stinky butt."
But then, after we met the marshal, you said something very strange.
It was "squirt-anly," wasn't it?
No, something much stranger.
[slowed audio] You were right.
I knew then that you were up to something, so I followed you here.

Nope.

Don't you want to see Kevin?
Of course I do.

Hey, everyone, just want to introduce you to our new assistant manager, Larry Sherbet.

Son of a bitch.
Larry, you want to say a few words?
Absolutely. Thanks.
Hey, everybody.
Uh, couple things about my management style.
Number one: don't nobody ask me about what's in my cup, we ain't gonna have no problems.

Why would he do that?
Perhaps he had a good reason.
Wrong, Mr. Fart. He was a jerk and he sucked.
But he was the one who motivated me to get off my ass and get this job, so in a way, we really have him to thank for all this happening.
