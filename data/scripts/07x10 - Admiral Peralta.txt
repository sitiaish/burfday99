[bright tones]
- And I believe that's all I've got.
Oh, wait, there's one more thing.
Peralta gave me a note before the meeting.
Ugh, the penmanship is horrid, but I think it says,  "Ask if anyone has an a**l mint."  - It's announcements, and we do.
- Wow, what an entrance.
- Amy and I have some big news to share.
- I'm pregnant.
- We're pregnant!
- Wow, I can't believe it.
- Congratulations.
- What a surprise.
- What the hell?
I thought you guys would be  more excited than that.
Charles, you didn't even faint.
- I'm so sorry, I'll try.
[inhales]
It's not working.
Somebody choke me.
- On it.
- Rosa.
Sorry, we're so happy for you,  but we also maybe, kind of already knew.
I mean, you didn't do the best job of hiding it.
Why have you been carrying that box around so much?
- I just love this box.
- Why are you reading that newspaper?
It's two days old.
- I just love this issue.
- Hey, why are you wearing that hazmat suit?
- I just love this look.
- Okay, fine, so you all knew we were pregnant.
Good for you.
But I bet you didn't figure out  that we're having twins.
- [gasps]
- No, not really.
It's one baby.
I just needed to see Charles faint.
[upbeat music]
â™ª  - Aw, Jake.
I am excited that you're having a kid.
- Thank you, Dad.
Oh, and hey, if you're free  next Friday, we're having a s*x reveal party.
- Well, I went to one of those in Amsterdam.
I would not invite relatives.
- What?
No, no, no.
It's a party where we find out the biological s*x of the baby  in a surprising way.
- You better hope you're having a girl.
Peralta fathers do not get along with sons.
- What?
That's not true.
I mean, look at us.
We're doing better than ever.
This year, you even remembered my birthday month.
- Things are good now, but honestly,  it's probably just a blip.
- Well, that's fun to hear.
- Well, that's just the way it is.
It's the family curse.
I haven't talked to my father since you were 10.
His dad abandoned him at the World's Fair.
His dad fled to America after drowning his dad in a well.
- Oh, my God.
Okay, so yes, fine, there's a bit of a trend.
But we're not cursed.
You and I are good.
I bet you could even fix things up with your dad.
- The Admiral?
I always hoped that I could reconcile things with him  one day, but he's not going to let that happen.
What can I tell you?
We're not meant to have sons.
There's a demon in our genes.
- Title of your s*x tape.
- No, the title of my s*x tape  is "Cockpit Larry and the Mile High Stewardae."  - What?
- "Stewardae."  It's plural for stewardess.
- Okay.
- ADA Kurm, how are you?
- Do you want the real answer, about how my wife's leaving me,  or do you just want me to say, "Good, how are you?"  - The latter?
- Good, how are you?
- We're fine; why are you here?
- You know that Carroll Street Brownstone B&amp;E?
- Yeah, broken windows, swiped an old TV.
- The house belongs to a friend of the mayor's.
- Oh, I didn't realize the case was a priority.
I'll check into it right away.
- Great, call me as soon as you have anything.
- Yeah.
Will do.
Oh, God, what a nightmare.
- Agreed.
Dude's a mess.
You know he's only 24?
- No, the Carroll Street case.
I didn't realize that the mayor was interested in it,  and I think I did something bad.
- You gave Hitchcock and Scully an important case?
- [sighs]
both: [snoring]
- Okay, here's the cake.
If it's pink on the inside, it's a girl.
And if it's blue, it's a boy.
- And why do you seem so bummed by that?
- Because I still think you should have done the pig roast,  where we start eating it from the snout,  and discover the baby's s*x when we get to the genitals.
- Yeah, you know, Amy wanted to do that too,  but I just don't see it.
- Hmm.
[phone chimes]
- I'm getting a text.
Ooh.
"I will see you soon, sir."  Guess who that was.
- Elton John.
- What?
- You said "sir," and that's on you.
- No, it was my grandfather, the Admiral.
- Whoa, you tracked him down?
- Yup, he's on his way to my apartment right now.
I'm going to fix his relationship with my dad.
It's going to be very emotional.
- It's going to be so dramatic.
You should be  producing for Ellen.
- Do you really think so?
'Cause I actually have another idea for a segment  where Ellen turns your home into a haunted house.
I call it "Extreme Makeover: Bone Edition."  [sighs and sniffles]
But you know, I...
I don't have to do it.
I like being a cop.
- And you're so good at it.
- Yeah, okay, I'm going to go meet my grandpa.
- Yup.
[flute playing "Muffin Man"]
- Ooh, fun!
Terry's playing the flute.
- At work.
Who are you, William Wonka?
- No, this is police business.
The flautist for the NYPD band retired,  and I'm going to audition to take her spot.
Captain Holt, you love music.
Can you give me some pointers?
- I'd rather not.
The music they play is dreck.
Last month, they performed Sousa  at a fallen officer's funeral.
And the people were so appalled, they cried.
- Or they were crying for the deceased.
- No, she was very unpopular.
The band made them cry.
- [whistles]
- Suffice it to say, I don't respect what they do,  so I wouldn't be the right teacher.
I'm sorry.
[knock at door]
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Attention!
- Oh.
- At ease.
Just pulling your leg.
I'm your grandfather, not your commanding officer.
Now, come on.
- Aw.
- Give me a handshake.
- Okay.
Right, come on in.
- Wow, it's really been quite a while, huh?
- Yeah.
- Are you still watching  those cartoons about the karate lizards?
- The "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"?
I am.
There was recently a reboot.
They did some interesting things  with Splinter and Krang's backstories.
Anyways, I'm an adult now.
How are you?
- Oh, me?
Well, I guess I'm...
- Grandpa?
- What?
- Oh, I was just asking how you were.
- Oh, sharp as ever.
- Yeah.
- I'm so glad you reached out to me.
- Same, you know, now that I'm having a baby of my own,  I've started to realize how important  father/son/grandfather relationships really are.
Which reminds me, my dad is also coming.
- He is?
I'm surprised he wanted to see me.
- Well, he doesn't exactly know you're here.
I thought it might be cool to surprise both of you.
- You know who else thought surprises were cool?
Admiral Yamamoto, and we all know what happened then, huh?
- We do?
- Pearl Harbor.
- Pearl Harbor, right.
Some surprises can be bad.
But this one's not gonna be.
This one's gonna be good,  just like...
- The Battle of Midway.
- The Bimble of Durbay.
Yup.
We both said the same thing at the same time.
[knock at door]
Oh, that's my Dad.
This is going to be amazing.
- Hey, Jakey.
- Roger Peralta.
Prepare to hug and cry.
This is your father.
- Dad, you son of a bitch.
- Uh-oh.
Ow!  .
- [groans]
I can't believe you hit me.
- I'm sorry.
- My face is throbbing.
Hey, "Dino Bites."  - What the hell is my father doing here?
- You said you wanted to reconcile.
- I meant after he was dead.
I planned on standing over his grave  and yelling, "I forgive you."  - Well, you may get the chance sooner than you think.
He keeps trailing off and staring into space.
- [scoffs]
That's his old trick.
Whenever he doesn't want to talk about something,  he does that.
The old b*st*rd.
- Look, I know you don't like him,  but can you at least try to be nice for me?
- Okay.
I'll be nice.
I wish you were dead, you lousy son of a bitch!
- You said you were gonna be nice.
- I lied so I could say the "son of a bitch" thing.
- Dad!
- Okay.
Your grandson would like us to make peace.
So, do you apologize for being the worst father  in the history in the world?
Even worse than fathers  who chain their children in basements?
- I do not.
- That's on him.
I tried.
- I really don't think you did.
- Jake, you don't get it.
He's a heartless jerk.
When I was in high school, I almost died.
He didn't even visit me in the hospital.
- Okay, so maybe start by asking him  to apologize for that.
- No, he should apologize to me for being in the hospital.
- I'm starting to see the heartless thing now.
- Growing up, he had a boat.
Meant everything to him.
He named it "Walter," after himself.
- She was the child I never had.
- I was the child you did have.
Anyway, one day I took Walter Junior out for a spin.
I was trying to impress one of the lake girls.
Before I met your mom, I was a bit of a ladies' man.
- Yes, that continued long after you met my mom.
- He's always been a floozy.
- It was dark.
I crashed into the dock; I woke up in the hospital.
- How was the girl?
- Flexible.
Man, she could put her leg-- total--  - No, I was-- after the accident.
- Oh, right!
No.
She was totally unhurt, thank goodness.
But I was in the hospital for three weeks,  and Admiral Ass never visited me once.
- I warned you not to take the boat out.
You make mistakes, you got to accept the consequences.
- I'm your son!
- And Walter was my daughter.
- [groan]
- Okay, both of you, stop.
You're acting like children.
You know what?
That's it, if you're gonna act like kids,  then I'm gonna act like a parent.
- "Cry Hard with a Vengeance"?
- Yeah.
It's Bruce Willis' book about parenting.
And we're gonna read it.
- I just got another call from the saddest ADA in the world.
He's still pissed.
Did Hitchcock and Scully  get anywhere?
- Hard to say.
Their file contains a lot of non-case related documents.
- A bunch of menus?
- A cease and desist letter from TJ Maxx.
- Multiple patent submissions  for something called a "pillow shoe."  - An application for a time share in Figi.
- You mean Fiji.
- No, Figi with a G.
They're getting scammed.
- Wait.
This is good.
There was a witness who saw everything.
Identified the thief, they even described the getaway car down  to a dent in the right bumper.
We're golden.
- Yeah, but Hitchcock and Scully forgot to write down  the witness' name or contact info.
- What?
No, that's insane.
Even they wouldn't do something that dumb.
- Dumb?
Excuse me.
I don't need this crap.
I could be on the beach in Figi right now.
- If we go to court, we're gonna need  the witness to testify.
But now, we have no way of contacting him.
So there's no case.
How could you not take down the witness' contact info?
- Well, unlike you dorks, we don't do everything  "by the book." - We play by our own rules.
- And we get results.
- Mm-hmm.
- No!
You don't!
That's why we're here!
- So John McClain's advice wasn't great,  but I have other books.
This one says  to make sure neither of you has a full diaper.
Feels like we can skip that part.
- I wouldn't be so sure.
- Dad, come on, all right?
How about this?
Dad, just name one happy memory that you have with Grandpa.
And don't say the memory you're going to have at his funeral.
- All right, when I was eight, he was on shore leave,  and we played catch in the yard, and that was fun.
- Hey, there you go.
That was great.
And Grandpa, is there a happy memory you want to share?
- Well, can I pick the catch thing too?
- Yeah, sure.
- 'Cause that was really  a nice time.
While we were playing,  the neighbor kid fell off his bike.
- Yeah, he broke his arm.
- You could see the bone.
- [laughs]
Do you remember when we went  skiing, and the guy fell off the lift and busted his leg?
- And you could see the bone.
- It was just, like,  sticking right out of the skin, and he's, like, screaming.
We were laughing.
- Oh, oh, it was beautiful.
- God, I hope somebody found him.
- Okay, well, you guys are both monsters,  but this is going great.
[flute music]
- Yes, yes.
- I know you're being positive,  but I could use some honest criticism.
- Terry, I'd love to help, but...
Follow me.
- Hello.
[laughs]
You caught me stretching.
I've been doing this  and nothing else for the last half hour continuously.
- I saw you watching Terry.
You were finger conducting.
- Fine.
Yes.
I may have overstated my contempt for the music  they play so that I wouldn't have to help Jeffords.
- Oh, no, am I so bad, I can't be helped?
Aw, man, I wanted to play in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Terry loves being in and among floats.
- You're not bad.
You're maybe even...
Good.
But to make you great,  I'd have to break you down to nothing.
It would ruin our friendship.
- I can handle criticism.
My daughters criticize me all the time.
They're so mean now.
Please help me, sir, please!
- Okay.
Give me your flute.
Wrong!
First rule:  never give anyone your flute.
- Hey, babe, how's it going?
- Amazingly well.
My dad and my grandpa are actually getting along.
They've been catching up nonstop.
- Aunt Millie?
- Dead.
- Uncle Thomas?
- Dead.
- Aunt Janet?
- Dead.
- Uncle Dean?
- Gay.
- Ooh, good for him.
What about Aunt Lyn?
- Dead.
- Apparently there was a fire at the family reunion.
Lucky for my Uncle Dean, he was not welcome at the event.
- Wow.
Dark.
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm glad everything's working out.
Oh, I got to go.
Love you, bye.
- Actually, I got to go too, so...
[dial tone]
- I didn't even think it was possible to put a cast  on that part of the body.
- [laughing]
- That was Amy.
I hung up first.
Looks like things are still going great in here.
- Yeah, they sure are.
Hey, Dad, toss me a beer.
Bring the heat.
Whoa!
both: [scream]
- No, the s*x reveal cake!
- Oh.
- Nobody look at the floor!
No one can see the color of the cake.
- How long are we doing this?
What's the plan?
- I don't know yet! .
- Okay, we all heard the cake splat  on the other side of the counter,  which means we can probably assume you can see the color.
- Why does that matter?
- Because the color of the cake  tells us if we're having a boy or a girl.
- How can that baker tell?
- Because the baker does the test.
- No, the doctor does the test.
Then the doctor calls  the baker, and the baker makes the cake.
- Okay, I hate to say this, but can you start over?
- No, we don't have time.
Just help me fix this.
- You know, it's Roger's fault.
All he had to do was catch the beer.
- Well, maybe I'd be better at catch if I played it  more than once growing up.
- Guys, focus up.
We're all getting along, remember?
Now, we can't see the cake before Amy, which means we have  to figure out a way to clean it up without looking at it.
[gasps]
We have to "Birdbox" it.
- And "Birdbox" is the bakery.
- No, "Birdbox" is a movie  where people aren't allowed to look at things.
Just put on these blindfolds and help me clean it up.
- I "Birdbox-ed" the stewardess in Sweden once.
- Dad!
[clock ticking]
Okay, that should be all of it.
I think it's safe to take off our blindfolds--  Oh, [bleep]!
No, no!
Oh, God!
[bleep]!
What happened?
We were so careful.
Here comes the mop.
- Bag.
[grunts]
- This is hard.
- Yeah.
I could use a beer, you know?
- Oh, oh.
- You okay?
- The cake was blue.
You're having a boy.
It's the curse.
- No.
No, no, no, there's no curse.
Look, we can still fix this.
All we have to do is clean  every inch of this room, and then bake a gourmet cake.
- No one can do all that in two hours.
- Wrong, Dad.
There is one who can.
[suspenseful music]
- Hello, fellas.
Let's get to work.
[cake mixers rev]
- Oh, hey.
I got something.
There was a security camera by the Carroll Street brownstone.
- And it got footage of the perps?
- No, but it caught Scully and Hitchcock  interviewing the witness.
- All right.
Let's start canvassing the neighborhood,  see if anybody recognizes that guy.
- Yeah.
- Wait!
- What the hell?
- Sorry, I didn't want to run,  and that was the only way to stop the doors.
- It wasn't, and it didn't.
- It worked, we're here.
- Please, don't go looking for that witness.
- We're just trying to fix your screw-up.
- We didn't screw up.
The witness gave us his name,  but he asked us not to write it down because he's undocumented.
- So he's scared to show up to testify at the courthouse  because he didn't want to be detained by ICE.
- Damn it.
- You know,  that keeps lots of immigrants from helping cops.
- Yeah, we know that.
We're just surprised  that you know that.
- That's insulting.
I'm very concerned with immigration issues.
- And I've dated my fair share of spicy--  - No!
- Scully said the nice thing.
You don't need to go past it, Hitchcock.
- Okay, I know you need help and time is tight,  but I see there is blue cake on the floor,  and I know what that means, vis-Ã -vis the s*x of the baby.
So before we do anything, I'm going to need a minute.
[clock ticking]
Sorry for all the weeping and the weird snort noise  I made at the end.
It's genetic.
Now, Jake, grab the mop, you're on cleanup.
Admiral, you're making the batter.
Captain, you're on frosting duty.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
[clock ticking]
- Okay, Amy just texted.
She's gonna be here any second, so hide that thing.
- The...
Oh.
- Dad, that is so noticeable.
- Nuh-uh, it's awesome.
- All right, everybody, act normal.
Act normal.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, welcome home.
I'd like you to meet my grandpa, Walter.
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Hello, things are normal here.
- Yeah, everything's totally normal...
Back here too, behind the chair.
- Yup, and that was a normal thing to say.
Are things normal with you, Amy?
- Sure.
- Cool.
- I'm going to go get ready for the party.
- Oh, fun.
[door opens and closes]
Oh, my God, I can't believe we pulled it off.
Charles, we owe it all to you.
- Stop, it was an honor to cook and clean with all of you.
- Boy, Jake is so lucky to have you as his butler.
- Oh, he's not-- - Thank you.
- Oh.
- I'm so glad you're helping me.
Maybe I won't blow it after all.
- Oh, you'll do plenty of blowing...
Of that flute.
Now, let's go.
A five, six, seven, eight.
- [plays "The Muffin Man"]
- Stop.
The nod meant start now, not start one second later.
Again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
- [plays "The Muffin Man"]
- Stop.
[metal chair clangs]
Are you playing "The Muffin Man" or "The Garbage Man"?
- Huh?
- Do you know the Garbage Man?
Because I do.
Because I'm looking right at him.
Again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
- [plays "The Muffin Man"]
- â™ª Bum, bum, bum, badum, bum, bum â™ª  ["The Muffin Man" playing]
Again.
[clapping]
Again.
â™ª Bum, bum, bum, badum, bum, bum â™ª  â™ª Da, da, da, da  Why did you stop playing, Garbage Man?
- I need some water.
- What you need to do is keep practicing, Garbage Man.
- I don't have any more saliva.
- And I don't have any more  time for your excuses, Garbage Man.
Now play again.
Five, six--  - I don't want your help anymore!
I'm not a garbage man!
I'm a muffin man!
[glass clinks]
- Attention, everyone.
Thank you all so much for coming.
Please gather around.
We're going to cut the cake and find out  what our baby's whole downstairs situation is.
- Why the accent?
- I don't know.
I did so bad.
I should have let you talk.
- Yeah, you should have.
- Okay.
- I love you.
- Oh.
- Okay, let's do this.
Here we go.
- [chuckles]
- All right, we are having a...
Green.
Oh, my God.
What's inside of me?
- No, you just cut a bad slice.
Here, I'll get a good one.
- I guess the bakery must have messed up.
- What are you talking about?
Roger's the one that added the food coloring.
- Well, you mixed the batter.
- Wait, did you guys bake that cake?
- Well, we just, you could say that...
- Jake?
- Okay, fine.
Yes, we baked it.
I'm so sorry.
I'll explain everything later.
Dad, please stop cutting the cake.
- I'm trying to find a good slice.
- There is no good slice!
You screwed it up!
You're a screw-up!
- Yeah?
Well, if I'm a screw up, it's 'cause you screwed me up.
You screw-up.
- Screw you.
I'm leaving.
- Wait, wait, no, don't go!
We reversed the curse!
Don't reverse the curse reverse!
- Actually, Jake, I'm going too.
- What?
No, why would you go?
- I need to go to the hospital.
I cut my thumb off.
- Again?
- The other one.
all: [groaning]
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.
Ah...
Get the "Dino Bites."  .
- Hey, how are you feeling?
How's the thumb?
- Great, looks perfect.
Like nothing ever happened.
- It's the other thumb, Dad.
- Oh, no, yeah, that looks bad.
- The doctor said it might take a long time to heal,  and that it might never be as long again.
- My thumb?
I don't care.
Is my dad here?
- No.
I called him and he said...
How do I put this?
- That I'm a useless screw-up and he's done with me?
- Yeah, something exactly like that, verbatim, sure.
Look, I'm really sorry that I forced this  whole reunion on you.
I think our family might be  cursed, and I'm going to be a bad dad.
- No, I was wrong.
There's no curse.
My dad is just a selfish dick.
And I was too.
All the other Peralta dads, we probably just learned it  from each other.
- Or it's just in our genes.
- No, you proved that wrong.
You care, and you do the work.
You're reading parenting books before your kid is even born.
You tried to get me and Dad back together.
Hell, you even fished my thumb out of the cake.
- Yeah, that was gross.
- You're so excited about having a kid,  you're having a s*x reveal party.
I never did anything like that,  except that one time in Amsterdam.
- I really wish you'd stop bringing that up.
- Jake, you're going to be a great dad.
And your son's gonna love you.
- Thanks.
And I think you're going to make a real good grandpa.
- Hey,  who's got two surgically reattached thumbs  and is super proud of his son?
- Oh, you don't have to--  - This guy--  [screaming]
- My boss is furious.
You ruined my 25th birthday.
I want those guys punished.
- Understood.
I'll talk to them right now.
Without that witness, the DA has nothing.
Kurm is pissed.
- It's true.
He kept calling you guys the human centipede.
- Because we have our heads up our asses.
Yes, we've heard that before.
- I never thought I'd say this,  but you guys did the right thing.
- Unfortunately, Kurm wants you disciplined.
So effective tomorrow,  you're each getting one week paid suspension.
- Like vacation?
- You deserve this punishment!
- [whispers]
It's punishment where you don't have to work.
- And we can go anywhere we like?
- You can go to hell for all I care!
- [whispers]
Or to a resort where you're being scammed.
- Figi.
Good idea.
- Now, get out of my face!
- [whispers]
Have fun.
- Next.
- Hi, my name is Terry Jeffords.
And I don't know how this is going to go--  - Wait!
- Sir.
- I'm Captain Raymond Holt of the 99th precinct,  and I need to tell you about this man.
Now, the audition piece he's about to play may not  be technically perfect.
In fact, it may hurt your ears.
You may consider it an insult to music.
You may whisper to each other,  "'Muffin Man'?
Pssh!
More like Garbage Man."  - Come on.
- But you would be wrong.
This man has taught me something.
He's taught me that music is about heart and soul.
It's about perseverance.
Despite everything  I put him through, he showed up here today.
And you would be a fool not to put him in your band.
- Thank you, Captain.
Lieutenant?
What instrument do you play?
- The flute.
- You're hired.
- What?
I haven't even played.
- You're the only flute who auditioned.
Welcome to the band.
- Yes!
I did it!
â™ª  - Hey.
How's your dad doing?
- Well, the doctor said he'll be okay,  but his hands are basically claws now.
I don't know why they think that's okay.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry the cake was green.
- It's okay.
I'll love our little Shrek no matter what.
- Oh, my God.
That's right.
You still don't know the s*x of the baby.
With all the craziness, I almost forgot.
Emphasis on "almost." - What?
- Well, I got another cake just for the two of us.
- Jake, that's so sweet.
- Here we go.
- I'm so excited.
It's empty.
There's no cake inside.
- What?
Where'd it go?
- Hey, guys.
Do you have any milk?
- [gasps]
We're having a boy?
- We're having a boy!
- [giggles]
- Hey, do you have milk or not?
- Jeez.
- God.
