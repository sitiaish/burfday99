And so concludes this year's Secret Santa drawing.
Just a quick reminder of the rules:  $40 limit, no perishable items,  and no homemade massage coupons, Hitchcock.
Fine, then everyone'll have to pay full price for them.
Oh, Captain.
I would like a $40 gift card  to any restaurant that serves nachos.
- I don't have you, Peralta.
- Not only do I know  that you do indeed have me, but I also know  - who everyone else has.
- That's not possible.
Perhaps not for an ordinary man such as yourself, Jeffords.
But for the brilliant mind of Detective Sherlock Peralta...
I legally changed my name...
it's quite simply..
elementary.
For, you see, Amy made a face  I only recognized from our bedroom,  which means that she has Captain Holt.
Charles has Terry.
His eyes keep  - shifting over to him.
- No, I don't.
Terry looked disgusted, which means he has Hitchcock.
Rosa didn't draw a name, nor did she put one in.
- She doesn't wanna participate.
- Never do.
Hitchcock moves his mouth when he reads  and he quite clearly said Charles.
- I did get Charles.
- Scully has Amy.
He's hold his paper name-side out.
- Oh, he's good.
- And I have Scully,  which means Captain Holt has me.
I'll be taking that gift card.
Daddy loves nachos.
Should we draw the names again and leave Jake out?
ALL: Yeah!
No!
Sherlock wants a present!
[UPBEAT MUSIC]  Okay, quick update on the Warren Street break-in.
Security cameras caught a picture  of the suspect and guess what?
That's right.
We got a hot perp alert.
- [IMITATES AIR HORN] - ALL: Ooh!
- That's a handsome man.
- Mm, I'd like to  - bring that guy to justice.
- We all would.
But unfortunately, police cornered him  and he shot himself in the face.
- [BLOWS RASPBERRY] - All right.
Thank you for that  shockingly dark update.
- Anything else?
- Uh, yes.
Something I'd like to say.
I'm a pretty private person so this is kinda hard for me, but...
here we go.
I'm bi-sexual.
All right.
I will now field one minute and zero seconds  of questions pertaining to this.
- Go.
Amy.
- How long have you known?
Since seventh grade.
I was watching "Saved by the Bell"  and I thought, Zack Morris is hot.
And then I thought Lisa Turtle, also hot.
The fact that the words Kelly and Kapowski  didn't just come out of your mouth is lunacy.
What made you decided to tell us now?
Charles found out on the road trip  and I was positive he was not  gonna be able to keep the secret for much longer.
Bye Rosa.
I mean, not "bi," but bye!
I mean, see ya!
I mean, have fun only having s*x with men.
Just bangin' dudes, left and right.
I just stopped saying bye all together.
So are you seeing anyone now?
- Yeah.
Her name's Tiffany.
- Are you lying about her name  - so we won't look her up?
- Yes, I am.
Next.
- Do you know Anne Heche?
- I do.
- Ohh.
- I must say, this is going  considerably better than when I came out to my colleagues.
They were not, as the kids say, awake.
- Do you mean woke?
- I did mean woke.
But it's grammatically incoherent.
Okay, we have time for one more question.
- Oh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Nope.
Absolutely not.
We're done.
Smart.
It was not tasteful.
Is anyone else having trouble with the Internet?
I've been trying to file a warrant request  for 45 minutes and the stupid server keeps timing out.
Nothing's loading.
It's all pinwheels.
This all started when Cyber Crimes moved in downstairs.
I bet those jerks are hogging our bandwidth.
Man, I miss the s*x Crimes Unit.
I know!
They were so fun.
Remember their Christmas Party?
- [LAUGHS] - Okay, Sergeant Jeffords and I  will talk to Cyber.
Tell them I can't get on WebMD.
My nipple tripled in size and I wanna know  - if it's good or bad.
- Can't believe that's good.
Hey.
Was that weird earlier?
You mean when Charles showed us those pictures of Nikolaj  taking a very sudsless bath?
Yes, it was uncomfortable.
No, I mean when I told everyone I was bi.
- Was it too touchy-feely?
- Rosa, no.
It was great.
And don't worry, just because you opened up a little bit  doesn't mean everyone's gonna be less afraid of you.
- We're all still terrified.
- Thanks, Jake.
- So how'd your parents take it?
- Uhh...
- I haven't told 'em yet.
- Really?
I mean, of course, you don't have to but I just thought  you guys were getting closer since prison.
No, I mean, we are.
It's just,  I don't know how I would say something like that.
Especially to my dad.
He's super traditional.
I'm afraid this would just mess everything up.
We've been having so much fun lately.
♪ ♪  - I don't wanna lose that.
- Okay.
Maybe just be honest with them.
Right?
Tell 'em how you feel.
Like, you could say,  Mom, Dad, I'm bisexual.
But I'm still your daughter.
I'm still the same person that I've always been.
And who I love will never change that.
And you guys raised me to be strong and confident.
And I don't wanna hide who I am anymore.
I am bi.
Damn.
That was...
And I know that this may come as a shock to you,  but it's my truth.
So I hope you can accept that.
- Jake...
- Maybe you still see me  as your little girl, but I'm woman now.
And I know my own heart.
- You done?
- Yeah.
Wow, that felt amazing.
I really disappeared into it.
- Should I become an actor?
- Absolutely not.
- Copy that.
All right.
Good luck.

Keep it together, Jeffords.
Oh.
You must be Raymond Holt.
Whoa.
No.
Germs.
We just wanted to ask about the Internet.
Ever since you guys arrived, things have gotten  - slow for us upstairs.
- We're the Cyber Crimes Unit.
Kinda need the bandwidth.
Do you guys even use the Internet upstairs?
I thought you just write down your hunches  in your notebooks with your pens and paper.
I'll have you know you're speaking to your Captain.
Well, I'll have you know that we don't report to you.
We report to the Commissioner's office.
Ever heard of them?
I don't care who you report to, this is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna, um...
- put the wires...
- Right.
Um...
- Terry.
- Uh...
into the things.
And...
and beef up the speeds.
Got it?
We want beefy speeds!
Long story short, we remain un-beefed.
Unfortunately, we're out of options.
- They're just not scared of us.
- Right.
But there is one person who scares everyone.
Hey!
Captain Holt, Terry, Charles,  I wanna say...
Alan?
Close.
It's Amy.
This is nice.
I can't believe  - you're buying me dinner.
- Oh, well, you really  - helped me today.
- Did I?
I felt like I sorta straight-splained  how to come out to you.
No, it was good practice.
I think I'm ready to tell my parents.
That's awesome.
When are you gonna do it?
- In five minutes.
- What?
Actually, scratch that, they're here.
This is happening and I need you to be here with me  and also just step in and do it for me.
Rosa, I think that's a very bad idea.
And frankly, I'm not very comfortable...
Hello, Mr.
and Mrs.
Diaz!
America's favorite couple!
I didn't know Jake was joining us.
Neither did I.
What a fun surprise that none of us  were remotely prepared for, Rosa, right?
- You seem nervous.
Why?
- Uhh...
global warming.
What a bitch, right?
[LAUGHS] We all gon' drown.
Anyways, I'm gonna head to the bathroom  for the duration of one conversation.
No!
Uh, guys, I have something I need to tell you.
- What is it, honey?
- Uhh, Jake, you take it.
Seriously?
Me?
Oh, man,  now I really do have to go to the bathroom.
What, you didn't before?
You lied?
You know, Oscar, most people just ignore my nervous rambling.
Maybe shift focus back to Rosa.
Don't worry.
- We know what's happening.
- You do?
Of course.
You and Jake are dating.
That's why you were nervous.
'Cause you know I never liked him.
What?
Okay, first of all, that's insane.
We've only met once and we totally hit it off.
We talked about soccer, I called it fútbol.
Oh, I see what happened.
But secondly,  - Rosa and I are not...
- Denying that we're dating.
Uh, you're right.
We're a couple.
I love you, honey bun.
Uhh!
We need your help, Gina.
Gina, ugh, I haven't heard that name in a long time.
- It's on your jacket.
- I know,  but no one says it out loud and my baby can't read.
Which, I'm told is normal for a ten-week-old, so...
- How's little Enigma doing?
- We call her Iggy now,  but you're gonna wanna keep it down  because she's trying to take a nap, okay, Amy?
Oh, sure, I just feel like I was matching the same volume  - that you were speaking at.
- Amy, keep it down.
Yes, yes, babies are adorable.
They're like we are but so much smaller.
So we're here because we're having an issue  with the new Cyber Unit  that has moved into the second floor.
What happened to s*x Crimes?
They were so nice.
Remember their Christmas party?
- Oh, so good.
- [ALL IN AGREEMENT]  - Ohh.
- But now Cyber's  hogging our Internet and we can't get them to stop.
But you can intimidate anyone into doing what you want.
No, sorry, I can't.

So we need to change tactics.
We need to woo them  with the international language of friendship.
- Pork.
