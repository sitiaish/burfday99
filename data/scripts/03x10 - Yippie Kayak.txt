I'm about to give Captain Holt his gift.
Oh, did he lift his "no gift" policy?
No, he didn't.
But I figured out a way to buy him something and trick him into accepting it.
You are bad.
I know, right?
Oh, wait. You're making fun of me.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I don't care.
He would never open a gift, right?
But what if his gift didn't look like a gift?
He would open it?
Exactly!
I left it in a cardboard box on his desk.
There's no card, just the words "Open now," which I wrote with my wrong hand so he wouldn't recognize my handwriting.
Captain.
Santiago. Peralta.
Sir.
So just to recap, you left an unmarked package on a police captain's desk on a random Monday, with a suspicious message written on it that looked like it was scrawled by a crazy person.
Mm-hmm.
Bomb! There's a bomb!
Everyone out! Let's go, let's go!

Gross food, tan pants, "MasterChef Junior."
Ooh, I could call up one of those kids and offer them a free trip to New York.

Would you be cool with that?
No, that would eviscerate me.
I'll get my coat.

Oh, that's not necessary.

Also not necessary to touch my face.
It's Christmas. A time for friendship.
Damn it. All right.
I guess you'll just have to distract him when we get to the store.
On it.
I'll take him to housewares and I'll ask him the difference between a skillet and a frying pan.

They're not closed.
First time at a retail store, Oliver Twist?
They lock the doors, but if you're still inside, you get an extra 15 minutes to finish up.
Oh, perfect, so we should just try and sneak in an entrance through the back.

Right. Sorry. Also, there aren't 12 of them.

He's leaving tomorrow.
That's why he wants this over quickly.
He wants to storm the building.
No!
No, no, no. That is a bad idea.
Look, we still haven't figured out where they're holding Gina and the rest of the hostages.
If you guys come busting in here, things could go sideways real fast.
That's what I told him, but then he just repeated it back to me in a lady's voice.
Listen to me, Sarge.

No, I won't.
Fine.

Hey, go sit on that rooftop, guy.
Look, just give Jake a chance.
If he fails, then you can storm the building.
I'll give him a chance to sit on his little white butt and wait for me to come rescue him.
You tell him that I'm Liam Neeson and he's my hot, dumb daughter.
All right, we're outnumbered and unarmed.
If we're gonna get Gina back, we need weapons.
This place sells hammers, wrenches...
Do they sell plants?
Because some of that potting soil is very toxic if ingested in large quantities.
So you want to feed the bad guys a lot of soil?
Force-feed 'em.
Okay, that's a good option that I will definitely consider.
Now, let's go out there and gear our asses up.
