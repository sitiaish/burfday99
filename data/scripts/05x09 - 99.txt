I'll get back to you guys by the end of the day  with all the logistics.
Sergeant Terrance Jeffords,  four years ago on this exact date,  you told me I was too old to learn how to do the worm.
I vowed on that day to prove you a fool,  and today, I shall.

As I was telling the squad, our old C.O.,  Captain McGintley, just passed away.
Oh, no.
We're going to Los Angeles for the funeral next week.
I'll have the travel details later.
Hey, has anyone seen a worm?
Because this funky chicken's hungry.
Charles, a man has died.

Sad day.
Sad day.
It's crazy how different things were  when McGintley was Captain.
It was like the Wild West.
- Oh, yeah, we had some fun.
- I didn't.
In every one of those photos, I look uptight and worried.
Meanwhile, everyone else looks like  they're having the time of their life.
That's because they're all stress-free,  not like us Type A's.
Jake, am I too high-strung?
I wouldn't say you're too high-strung.
You just are high-strung.
You know, your strung is what makes you strung.
- You're strung strongly.
- No, not anymore.
From now on, I'm gonna be super chill.
So, where's the party at?
Trick question.
The party's right here, boy!
Oh, hello, Mrs.
McGintley.
My condolences for your loss.
So, who do you got your eye on?
- What?
- You haven't dated anyone  since you broke up with Pimento.
And funerals are a meat market.
Sadness is a powerful aphrodisiac.
No, it's not.
Then how come everyone cries during s*x?
I'm already seeing somebody, Boyle.
Oh...
And just like that, things got interesting.
And just like that, I left.
- Hello, Raymond.
- Oh, Chief Aggerton.
I didn't realize you'd be flying out for this.
I liked McGintley.
He was fun to have a beer with.
There's nobody in this department  I wanna have a beer with anymore.
Yes, that's the problem with the NYPD.
So, I hear you're meeting with  the Commissioner on Monday morning.
Well, you didn't hear this from me,  but...
Commissioner's retiring next year.
They put a short list together of possible replacements,  and you're on it.
- This is your first interview.
- Really?
- What?
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?
- What's going on is  Captain Holt has an interview to become the Commissioner  of the freakin' NYPD,  and he's gonna nail it and fulfill his destiny  as Lord High Commander of all Justice.
Okay, let's not get carried away.
Who says I'm even interested in becoming Commissioner?
You, constantly, including the first day I met you.
I'm interested in becoming Commissioner.
- Good to know.
- Fair enough, but even so,  it's probably a long shot.
I mean, there are many names on the list.
Nope, just four.
Yeah, three major league jags and you.
Sir, you're the perfect candidate:  smart, well-respected, you smell great.
That has nothing to do with the job.
It's just something I've been meaning to tell you.
- Is it sandalwood?
- Please calm down.
Right, totally.
Don't wanna jinx it.
I don't believe in jinxes.
Great, then you won't mind me saying it's a lock.
You're definitely gonna get it, and you're gonna smell even better  with that Lord High Commander of all Justice stank on you.
Let's do this  I can't wait to get on a plane.
I used up my miles, and upgraded first class.
- Damn, Sarge.
- This is gonna be great.

What is it?
- Nakatomi Plaza.

Can we pay our respects?
Ooh, our flight leaves in three and a half hours, and...

- Fine, just make it quick.
Yes!

That's the name of the driver in the movie.
We're going to Nakatomi Plaza.
There's gonna be role-play.
Oh, my God.

Okay, all 600 of these are great.
- We should probably head to the airport.
- We have more time, if you need it.
There's literally nothing left for me to shoot.
All right, let's get out of here.
The door is locked.
That's strange, I thought the guard propped it open.
I'd kick my way out, but I think these windows are bullet-proof.
We're not getting any reception in here.
Guys, it's cool.
We just gotta roll with it.
- You know, travel should be like jazz.
- Nuh-uh.
There's a lie-flat seat waiting for me,  and I wanna be napping in it,  with a hot towel wrapped around my big bald head!
- Help!
- All right,  everybody just calm down.
I'm sure that guard will be back in, like, five minutes.
We're gonna miss our flight.
I should be sitting next to a semi-famous person  that I can't quite place right now.
Come on, don't give up.
If we get rescued right now  and there's no traffic at the airport  and the van return goes smoothly  and Security's super chill about all the guns we have,  we could still make it.
- You guys okay up here?
- Yes!
See?
I told you not to give up hope.
It's a miracle.
- We're still gonna make it!
- Yeah, we missed our flight by a lot.
Yeah, but that's okay.
We can get the next one.
Let's see, next flight...
Cancelled.
Cancelled.
- Cancelled.
What is going on?
- There are huge storms in the Midwest.
- All flights are grounded.

I tried everything.
I begged.

I even told them  that Scully was a Make-a-Wish kid with a rare disease  that makes him look like a giant old baby.
- Did you call it Scullyosis?
- Damn it, Rosa,  that's really good and completely useless to me now.
They wouldn't even let me into a first class lounge,  since my flight had already departed.
I grabbed this and ran.

All right, stop hugging your mint.
We have bigger problems.
Captain Holt's Commissioners interview is on Monday.
- Can't he just reschedule?
- No!
He's gonna be up against the best of the best.
The slightest slipup could cost him the job, and...
but whatever, you know.
It is what it is, Daddy-O.
Look, Captain Holt helped us all achieve  our collective dream of going to Nakatomi Plaza.
- Only you.
- Now it's time for us  to return the favor and help him achieve his.
Get him back to New York in time for that interview.
Now, we have until Monday morning, and it takes...
48 hours to drive from L.A.
to New York.
- We've still got time.
- No, we don't.
I checked with all the car rental agencies.
There are no available vehicles.
I'm just gonna have to call the Commissioner, cancel this meeting.
No, not on my watch.
We just have to think.
There's gotta be a way to get you back.
Got it!
May I present to you the finest RV  that not much money can buy: The American Creeper.
No one should have to suffer like this for me.

Punch it.
- Why are you not punching it?
- I'm not comfortable  operating this vehicle at a speed greater  than the prevailing road and traffic conditions.
Fine!
I'll do it myself.
This is going great.
I'm already used to the bouncing and shaking.
- I smell smoke.
- Really?
All I smell is residual Scully.
I definitely smell smoke.
Pull over right now.
Well, I checked everywhere.
Nothing's on fire.
Nothing's even smoldering.
We just wasted ten minutes for no reason.
You know what, Captain, I think you're right.
I do smell smoke.
So, bottom-line this thing for me.
How long is it gonna take to fix?
- It's still on fire.
- She's gone, Jakey.
She's creeping her way to heaven.
Let's be honest, she's creeping her way back to hell.
All right, guys, we have to focus and think of a new plan  for getting Holt back for his interview.
Now, all we've lost is our only mode of transportation.
And our clothes and food!
All I have left is this first class mint,  and none of you get to eat him!
Well, perhaps we should just focus on  finding a place to sleep tonight.
I might have a solution for that.

Okay.

I love you too.
Can't sleep either, huh?

Is it a pleasure sound or pain?

Being in this bovine brothel is truly a nightmare.
Hey, I'm sorry that things didn't work out.
I know you always hoped that you'd be Commissioner.
No.
Over the course of my career,  I've learned that it's best not to have hopes.
Sir, that is so sad.
That's like saying it's best not to have dreams.
I only have one dream a year, always on Tax Day.
In it, I must file an extension.
So, yes, it is best not to have dreams.
Well, I still wish I could've got you back in time.
Why do you care so much about this?
I don't know,  it's your dream, and, you know,  you changed my life, made me wanna be a better man, or whatever.
Thank you for trying.

Maybe back off a little bit.
