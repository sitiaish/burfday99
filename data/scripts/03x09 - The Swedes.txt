It's a flawless 39-carat diamond that was stolen six weeks ago from the Royal Stockholm Museum.
I've just received word from Interpol that two detectives are on their way from Sweden to pick up the suspect.
Please make them feel welcome.

I'd love them.
It's never too late to teach yourself something new...

Great.
Why are you throwing those out?

I did graduate magna cum laude from Syracuse.

This is Inspector Knausgaard and Deputy Inspector Carlsson.
Their flight here was eight hours.
It's been a pleasure talking with you about the duration of your flight.
Good day.
Well, there goes my opening question about how long your flight was.
It was eight hours.
Yeah, no, I got that.
I was joking, sorry.
It must have got lost in translation.
No, we understand you perfectly.
Everyone in Sweden speaks English.
We also speak Norwegian, Dutch, German, French, Russian, and Finnish.
But not Danish.
That is a garbage language for garbage people.
Yeah.
Oh, word up.
Well, I have almost memorized "Gangnam Style" phonetically, so samesies.
I don't know this word. "Samesies"?
From context, I believe it means "proudly uneducated."
Ah.
So...
No.
Where's our prisoner?
Being processed.
But, in the meantime, may I offer you some of the finest cuisine in Brooklyn from my favorite restaurant?
The food cart outside the precinct.
It's really good.
Hm, none for Soren.
He's allergic to lactose, gluten, and tomato ketchup.
Oh.
Also, none for Agneta.
She and her husband are trying to have another baby, so she can't eat anything that will alter her cervical pH.
Oh.
You guys are real close, huh?
In Sweden, we believe for a proper team to function, partners must be completely open with each other.
Yeah. We have no secrets.
Not even our bodies.
We sauna together all the time.
Yeah, well, we are also very close.
One time, Rosa saw me in my bathing suit.
No, I didn't, you told me to turn around.
Yeah.
Well, uh, since we cannot eat your disgusting street food, could you please check if our prisoner has been processed?
Yeah, we don't mean to offend, it's just this place is filthy and you both seem unprofessional.
Unprofessional?
Well, we were going to take you to our favorite laser tag place, but now, you're officially uninvited.

In any case, I would be honored if you would take my place so that Raymond could make it a treble.
Absolutely! I would love to do that!
Great.
Formidable.
Yup!
That is great. This is great.
This is terrible.
Why?
You always said you wanted more face time with Holt.
No, not like this.
Squash brings out my competitive side.
Breaking racquets, cursing, excessive mooning.
One time, just to psych a guy out, I locked eyes with him and ate a squash ball.
That's not possible.
It's still in me, Terry.
Look, the point is to have fun.
So just relax and have fun.
Right, right, right, yeah.

Yup. Them.

If I got stung by a bee, I could die.
Detectives, I've been talking with the inspectors.
There's been a development in the Kottbullediamant case.
Excellent pronunciation, Captain.
Tack. They believe our perp may have smuggled more stolen Swedish diamonds into Brooklyn.
Oh, well, thank you for the tip.
Have a wonderful flight home.
We will send you the jewels as soon as we find them.
They're staying and working the case with you.
Ah, fantastic.
Rosa, could you please fill my car with a million bees?
Okay, since the Swedes are rudely late, let's talk anniversary gift.

Still don't care. How about I get a jump on our new partners and search the perp's apartment?
Right. We'll get some clues, solve the case, make them look like fools.
They can eat our American dust.
No, no.
Soren is probably allergic to dust.
Oh, hello!
Yes, I am allergic to dust.
Everyone is.

You're what sneezes are.
Okay. [clears throat]

Spaceship Earth? Way to go.

Gina, why did you want to take astronomy?
Because I thought it would be cool, just me, sitting around naming moons left and right, like "Zorp," "Bong," "Dingo."
"Etcetera," that would be one of the names.
"Etcetera."
She's gonna fail, isn't she?
Big time.
Yeah.
According to the shipping company, the container that came in on October 11th is 34G1.
Cool.
Hey, what did you and Marcus do for your six-month anniversary?
Keeping in mind, that he's dreamy and romantic and I only own $50.
Marcus and I broke up.
What? When?
A month ago.
A month ago?
How do I not know about this?
Because we don't talk about that crap.
We're not lame like the Swedes.
Right.
Yeah, totally.
If Agneta broke up with her husband, she'd probably be all, "Oh, Soren, I am so heartbroken," and he'd be like, "What can I do to help? I'm sorry," and give her a big old hug and she'd be all feeling better like an idiot.
We don't need to do that because what we do together is solve crimes.

Yeah, that's cool. Hey, this is weird because I hate you guys, but can I ask you a question?
If you broke up with your husband, would you tell Soren about it?
Are you making a funny laugh joke right now?
I would insist he be there for it so that my husband would have a shoulder to cry on.
Yeah, several years ago, Agneta and Lars were having trouble conceiving.
She didn't even have to ask me to donate my sperm.
I had it already in a "Tooperware," ready to go.
Wow, that's... so gross, yeah.
Can we ask you a question?
Mm-hm.
Why do you smell like fish?
Is it hygiene?
No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.
Did they?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Yeah. It would be pertinent to the case.
They didn't.
Although, one did have a battery in it.
What kind of a sicko feeds a battery to a fish?
Well, while you were wasting your time, we set up a meeting on 14 November with the man we think is the buyer.
Um...
No, don't worry, Soren.
I rescheduled your cycling practice for 16 November, and your dentist for 19 November.
You know me so well.

Ugh. Those guys suck.
They're so into each other, they're probably gonna start holding hands.
Oh, they're actually holding hands.

All tall and beautiful, and you don't want to know what they've got in their "Tooperware."
But honestly, I don't know that it's that bad that they're close.
Wrong, it's the worst.
Okay.
Oh, my God, I just figured out where the diamonds are.
We thought the shipping container came in on October 11th, 10/11, but dumb Europeans write their dates backwards.

No! The important thing is that we win the trophy.
Because I promised Kevin before he left for Paris that we would do that.
Do you know why I chose you as my partner?
Because I'm the most athletic person you know?
No, because of an article I read in the "Sarah Lawrence Phoenix" about a young man they called "squash's unhinged lunatic."
