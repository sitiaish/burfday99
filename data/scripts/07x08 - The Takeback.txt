Peralta, you need to come with me right now.
Can I eat my bagel?
Trust me, you're not gonna wanna eat before you see this.
That's Shane Reed.
Got pulled over this morning.
Son of a bitch!
Peralta... Peralta, calm down.
Why am I here? I didn't do anything.
You broke into    houses, Shane, but that's not what I care about right now.
All I care about is what we found in your car.
- I don't understand.
Why don't you fill him in?
"You are invited to celebrate the wedding of Katherine Joyner and Douglas Judy."
Douglas Judy, AKA Doug Judy, AKA, the Pontiac Bandit.
- Maybe.
Now tell me, Shane, when did you get the invite?
What?
When did you receive the invite in the mail and how come I didn't get one?
Why would you get an invite?
Hey, I'm the one asking the questions here!
Calm down, Jake.
Okay, good point.
- I said how big is the venue?
I... I... I... I don't know!
Yeah, I guess.
Well, then I guess you better tell it to me, Shane.
You wash my back, I'll wash yours.
- Wash?
You know I meant scratch.
I think it's "dougandkateforever."
There, was that so hard, Shane?
You did the right thing.
Now get this piece of trash out of my sight.
Oh, is forever spelled out, or is it the number four?
- Oh, it's spelled out.
Now get this piece of trash out of my sight!
I'm so glad you called.
Thanks for meeting me at my favorite establishment.
A place where you paint pottery?
I find a hand-painted mug makes a thoughtful gift for any occasion.
So, what's going on?
that you maybe want to tell me about?
I got a new job. I sit behind white CEOs when they have to testify before Congress, so they don't look so racist.
Every    minutes I just whisper some nonsense at 'em.
The texture of quiche is unsettling.
I got paid $  ,    for that nonsense.
That's cool, congratulations.
It seemed like a pretty cool fact to me.
All right, look, Judy, I know you're getting married.
Damn it, I didn't think you'd find out about that.
Who told you, Ronnie? Bobby?
Ricky? Mike?
Don't try and change the subject by tricking me
into singing New Edition with you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky and Mike...
♪ If I like the girl who cares who you like ♪
- Whoo!
No! Why didn't you invite me?
I wanted to, but a lot of people in my life are crooks and they think it's weird that I'm friends with a cop.
They just don't understand.
No, no more songs.
Look, I'm having my Bachelor party tomorrow night and I want you to be there.
Obviously that's a super cool plan, but no, I don't want your pity.
Suit yourself, but it's gonna be one sexy-ass weekend.
Like...
How sexy-ass are we talking here?
- Private jet to Miami, baby!
Forget the red carpet. Private jet!
Yes, and a jet! The jet is better.
- Miami, here we come!
Today is Holt's first day back in his office and I wanna make sure everything is just how he left it.
Now, I can't remember, was this little figurine of Cheddar at a    or    degree angle?
Terry, it's a five degree difference.
You better figure it out.
Ah, I missed this place.
Huh, little Cheddar's askew.
You really made yourself at home, didn't you Jeffords?
But, uh... no matter.
Just glad to be here.
I am a captain again.
Everything is perfect.
Wow... there's absolutely nothing that could puncture my...
- where's the business card?
The business card that was right here.
It had a piece of gum on it.
You didn't throw it away, did you?
No, Terry would never throw away something that looked exactly like trash.
Good. I'll be back in half an hour.
Make sure it's on my desk by then.
Will do, sir. I got it.
I'm on it.
I definitely threw it away.
I want you to meet the guys.
This is Nathan, Josh, and Chuck.
This is my buddy, Sean, from prison.
How's it going, fellas?
I've never heard you mention Sean before.
Yeah, well like he said, I just got out of jail.
Five years.
Tough sentence. What'd you do?
Elder abuse. Got my grandpa good, so...
Damn, that's very upsetting.
Damn straight it is.
Elder abuse?
I was trying to think of something that wouldn't inspire any follow-up questions.
Doug Judy!
Cubes! My man.
Sean, I'd like you to meet the man whose private jet we are flying on today.
Yeah, you're Mark Cuban.
How do you guys know each other?
Doug came on "Shark Tank" to pitch his idea for the Smush Shush.
It's a noise-cancelling blanket for secret s*x.
The product demonstration did not go well.
Robert fainted. Anyway, enjoy the jet.
Just bring it back in one piece, okay?
No promises, Mark Cuban.
I mean, we do wanna make sure the airplane stays in one piece though, right?
Nah, I saw, "Flight." If anything goes wrong, fly the plane upside down.
Oh, right, I forgot about "Flight," the movie, "Flight."
All right, let's rip it up!
- What's going on here?
We finally got a work order approved to fix the outlet, so...  we can get a third vending machine.
What?
A third vending machine.
Why are you whispering about getting a new vending machine?
- New vending machine!
Oh, that's why.
We asked you what model number.
I don't know, a normal one with glass in the front.
Seriously? Did you even look into the DiGiSnax    E?
I'd be into a fancy machine, too.
I was just reading about a Japanese one that serves shellfish.
We're not getting a shellfish machine.
Yeah, Boyle, we're getting a smart machine that suggests soda pairings based on your chip choice.
Or one with a make-it-wet gravy feature!
Okay, look.
At least Terry's not here to try to make me get a yogurt machine.
What was that about yogurt?
This jet is insane.
There's a private chef that'll make anything you ask for, no matter how expensive.
I just ordered lobster enchanté.
- Oh, damn, what's that?
I just said the fanciest words I could think of.
Oh, I'm gonna get the Veal Prime Minister.
Mm, that sounds good.
Hey, you wanna try out the Smush Shush?
What? You have one with you?
- I take it everywhere, baby.
- Yeah.
It's so heavy. It's crushing my bones.
Yeah, that was the Shark's problem with it, too.
I can't breathe. Get it off me.
Get it off me.
Yeah, you sound exactly like Barbara right now.
Disappointed in you, Jake.
Pilot says we're starting our descent.
- Then let's get changed, boys!
But these are my coolest clothes.
I got them from a targeted Instagram ad  after looking at photos of Cam Newton.
The outfit's beautiful, but it doesn't really say, "Miami."
What does say, "Miami?"
♪ Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga ♪
♪ I know you can't control yourself any longer ♪
♪ Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger ♪
♪ Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat ♪
Are you sure this is culturally okay for me?
- We're gonna find out.
♪ Come on, shake your body, baby, do that conga ♪
Damn, Judy, this place is nice.
Yeah, some Russian oligarch got the penthouse, but this is the second nicest room.
- Surprise!
What you doing here?
Nope, I was a real sweet pea, so they let me out for good behavior. What the hell?
What's this NARC doing here?
No!
What the hell was that?
Yeah, they're all suspicious now.
You have to help us convince them that Jake's not a cop.
Why? I don't understand why you invited him.
This was supposed to be a crazy weekend of boobs and butts.
Trudy Judy, you're not gonna see boobs or butts this weekend.
I'll see butts if I wanna see butts.
And Jake is here because he's my friend and he really wanted to come.
No, he's up to something.
He's probably here to arrest Chuck.
I would never arrest Chuck... but, I mean, why'd you say that? What did Chuck do?
Wow... cops always be copping.
That's not true. I do bad things.
One time I illegally downloaded an O-Town album!
Dang, that's one of the hardest boy bands.
Exactly, they're scary.
As long as nobody commits any major crimes in front of me.
It's not a problem. We don't have to break the law to have fun.
We gonna have some drinks, smoke some Cubans, eat a steak, either crazy big or crazy small, whichever's more expensive.
I'd rather see butts.
Fine, if I let you see butts, will you convince the guys that Jake's not a cop?
How many butts are we talking?
- Six.
- Seven.
Fine, eight, I'll meet you in the middle.
Nah, you waited too long.
-    butts!
- Just let her see butts, man.
Thank you for coming to my aid on the butt thing.
One step closer to trust.
I think I look like Andy Garcia in this hat.
- You look like Seth Green.
- No, Tom Green.
- You're thinking of Tom Green.
No, go back to Jason Mraz.
Okay, so Holt's gum-covered business card is long gone.
But I have a plan.
Great, what's the scheme?
Well, when I first moved in, I took a couple selfies to commemorate getting my own office.
- A couple?
Like you don't have any selfies.
Let me see your camera roll.
Zero photos? That's so much weirder!
- Thank you.
If you zoom in enough, you can see the business card.
We can recreate it and print a new one!
Wait, does that say "Zeff Wilcox"?
Zeff? No, it's probably Jeff.
You know, like a normal human name.
Names are all made up.
There's no such thing as a normal name.
"Terry."
I am not putting "Zeff" on that card.
It's your funeral.
Have you found my business card?
Uh... you know what,
I actually brought it home by accident.
I got confused because I know someone with that name.
You know another Zeff?
Yeah, he's married to Sharon's friend, Zudy.
We have dinner with Zeff and Zudy once a month.
You know, I'm gonna go home and get it.
Excuse me.
I think they swing.
So in the end, it's more than a vending machine.
It's a vending experience.
A vending experience that serves fried octopus balls?
It also serves eel balls and clam balls and... it's really just the three kinds of balls.
Oh, okay. On that horrifying note, Scully and Hitchcock, it's your turn.
Allow me to introduce you to the Q    .
She's got it all. Chips, candy, soda, and a whole lot of class.
That sounds great for snacking, but what if I'm stuck working late at the office?
How about a personal-sized frozen pizza?
And then what? I have to carry it all the way over to the microwave on my own?
Who has the time?
Well, you're in luck, because...
I get it! It cooks the pizza for you.
It cooks the pizza for you.
♪ And you know ♪
♪ It ain't fiction ♪
♪ Just a natural fact ♪
♪ Ooh We come together ♪
♪ 'Cause opposites attract ♪
No applause? Wow.
I'm still just a little confused.
Who is Sean, really?
Why'd your sister say he was a NARC?
- Is he a cop?
He caught me cheating on my boyfriend and he snitched.
It was a real dick move, but I have since forgiven him.
It's just weird that none of us  have ever heard of him before.
And we're paranoid because Doug still has that cop friend in the NYPD.
- That dude is not my friend.
- He dumb as hell.
- I'm always tricking him.
- Plus, he's short.
- You're a giant.
Seems unlikely. He's an adult.
But the point is, I'm Sean. Tall Sean.
Okay, well I'm glad to hear you're not a NARC,
'cause it'd have been real awkward considering what we did earlier.
Huh?
While you were checking in, we stole $   million  worth of diamonds from that rich Russian dude in the penthouse!
Bling, bling, baby!
You idiots. He's NYPD.
That's Doug's cop friend.
Wow... way to ruin Doug's bachelor party, Trudy.
What a buzz kill, right, guys?
I knew it was a mistake to invite a cop.
That's why you should only interact with people who are exactly the same as you.
That's a terrible lesson.
Sometimes things aren't lessons.
Sometimes things are just messed up facts.
Guys, relax, Jake wasn't gonna arrest anybody.
- No, I definitely was.
The diamonds aren't even here.
They confessed right in front of me.
Why would you pull a heist in the middle of my bachelor party?
You pulled a heist during my wedding.
Shh... he's a cop, man. Come on, chill.
- Judy.
What are we gonna do?
I say we tie this NARC up, leave him to starve, and disappear with the diamonds.
- Chuck.
- Thank you.
That's your issue with it?
I put a lot of work into this weekend.
I got us all shirts that say, "Doug's Dudes."
Ooh.
Sorry, but what's done is done.
It's not like we can put the diamonds back.
Hold up, that's a great idea.
We pull a reverse heist.
Does the Russian know his diamonds are missing?
No, we swapped them for fakes.
Perfect, that means he hasn't reported it.
- No harm, no foul.
I mean, obviously I love the premise and I think a reverse heist would make for a great movie and I already have the tag line, "This summer there are takebacks."
Love that.
The poster would be you and me back-to-back with our arms crossed, but no, I'm not onboard with this.
I'm a cop.
And a cop's job is to prevent crime and that's what you'd be doing.
Please, Jake. For me?
Okay, fine. 'Cause it's your bachelor party and only if I see them put back with my own eyes.
Yes! Deal. Reverse heist, baby.
The Takeback. Coming this fall to HBO.
It's a TV show now?
Well that's where all the best content is.
So what do you think?
Which gum looks the most like the one from the picture?
Two pink, too wet, too small, too chewed, too smooth, too wet, all wrong, too pink, too fresh, too dirty, too clean.
None of these work. You struck out.
We don't have any time. What do we do?
I don't know. Pick one and pray.
Uh... I'm gonna go with... you.
Not that one.
This one.
Hmm... it's a little less pink than I recall.
But I suppose we exaggerate the beauty of those we love.
It's good to have you back, old friend.
Can I ask why that card is so important?
Because of Zeff Wilcox.
He was a victim in the first case I worked.
- I always want to remember him.
And the words he wrote on the back.
The back... say what, now?
Why is this blank?
I threw it away. I thought it was trash.
I didn't know you kept it to remember someone you helped.
I didn't help Zeff, I failed Zeff.
His case was never solved.
The words written on the back were:
"Thanks for nothing."
Oh, man, that's rough.
I have held onto that card for    years because I always wanted to remember what it felt like to let someone down, so I'd never do it again.
That card made me the cop I am today.
Without it... I'm lost.
Since this seems important now, I want to be clear.
This is Terry's thing, I've just been along for the ride.
- Rosa!
So tell us how you stole the diamonds, so we can just reverse it.
Won't work.
It was a one-time opportunity.
And now the fakes are locked in the safe in a bodyguard-protected suite.
Well lucky for you, I have a long past in heist planning.
It's how I proposed to my wife.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
That's a great story.
Oh, thank you.
You see, once a year, at Halloween...
I can tell that I'm losing the room.
I'll just move on.
So here's how our thing is gonna go.
Every hotel safe has an override code,
in case guests leave them locked.
That code is kept on the concierge's computer.
Do you know who this is?
This is Matt Daniel, the most popular male ASMR performer on Twitch.
- ASMR performer?
I also crinkle paper.
We're trying to stream and the noise on the eighth floor is unacceptable.
My fans can't hear my mouth sounds.
I'm so sorry, I can't hear you.
That's the point, Georgina.
He says that's the point, Georgina.
This is taking too long. Make a video.
Tell your    million subscribers to never stay at this crap hotel.
No, no, no. I'll take care of it.
Let me talk to my general manager.
- You better run.
You'll strain your beautiful voice.
Once we hack into the computer
and get the override code,
Trudy will put on a housekeeper's uniform
and I will gracefully hide in her cart.
I got it myself.
Then, after the Russian goes out for the night,
Trudy will show up for turn-down service
and I sneak out when the guards are distracted by
Trudy's signature sexy housekeeping.
Trudy will then exit, leaving me behind in the suite
so I can unlock the balcony door for Chuck and Doug,
who are waiting outside on the window washer's rig.
Chuck will bring the stolen diamonds and I'll use
the override code to put them back where they belong.
Then, we head down to the room where we party like hell.
Trudy Judy...
It's exactly   , just like you promised.
- You did promise her butts.
Mmm... the smell of fresh cooked pizza.
Where are we? Rome, Italy?
Guys, you got the vending machine you wanted.
You can stop with the play acting.
I don't think that's scripted.
That's just them talking about pizza.
Yum, yum, yum.
I shouldn't have pushed for the fish ball machine.
I should've just played it safe and gone for the fish cake machine.
So you don't think the fish part was the problem?
- I don't.
Look at 'em.
My pizza!
You did it, Peralta.
You pulled off the reverse heist.
This whole time I thought you were a bitch... but truth is, you're actually that bitch!
He is, isn't he? He's that bitch.
I don't know if I want that nickname to stick.
Ooh, I hope my butts are back.
I do not like how butts have become your thing, Trudy.
- You used to love horses.
Guys, it's not butts.
I'm so sorry, Doug.
Miami PD!
It's just those three back there.
Hand on the table.
Jake, what the hell?
Cops always be copping.
Hey! Hey there, friends.
I tried to flag down your taxi as you were leaving the police station.
It was actually funny, 'cause we made a lot of eye contact, but you just drove off.
Anyways, I'm here now. We can go.
You want us to take you back to New York after you got my friends arrested?
Nuh-uh, you flying commercial, son.
I hope you get a middle seat.
I hope they charge you for your carry-ons.
I hope you sit next to someone chatty.
Someone going through something real hard.
I hope the pilot makes an announcement during the emotional climax of the movie you're watching.
- Ooh, you nasty!
Look, I'm sorry, but it was grand larceny.
I couldn't just let them get away with it.
Well if you were gonna arrest them anyway, why bother with the reverse heist?
It's like Trudy said.
We didn't have the diamonds.
But we put them back.
Yeah, only because I was there.
Not to mention the fact that I was fully complicit.
I could've gone to jail.
Wait, we destroyed your phone.
- How did you call for backup?
When Doug was distracted, yelling at the concierge...
Let me talk to my general manager.
I swapped out my waterlogged phone for his.
Damn, I would have noticed that if I wasn't trying to live in the moment and not look at my phone so much.
And then when I was hidden in the cart, I called the cops.
Mm, impossible. I would've heard you.
Not with the Smush Shush!
This is Jake Peralta.
Foot cramp, foot cramp.
First of all, how dare you!
Second of all, would you call Barbara Corcoran and tell her this product is not useless?
I don't know her. I'm sorry that I betrayed you, Doug, but I'm a cop. I didn't have a choice.
- We can still be friends, right?
Did you even illegally download that O-Town album?
No.
I bought it at their concert.
- You make me sick.
Doug!
Trudy!
Judy's!
Hey, sir.
I'm sure you're still mad at us.
Just you, not Diaz.
Okay, well, I can't get that card back, but I did bring you these.
They're business cards of people you've helped.
One mistake did not make you the cop you are today.
years of service to the community did.
That should be your motivation.
I know you can't remember their names, but...
Alex Chen. I do remember him.
-year-old male, carjacked at the corner of  th Avenue and   th Street.
Had three siblings, Alice, Arlene, and Anna.
Okay, so you remember Alex Chen.
Yes, and I really helped him.
Welcome back, Captain Holt.
I'm really glad we could help you with this.
Oh, no, you're not gonna just jump back in here now that it all worked out!
- Thank you, Diaz.
No, thank Terry. I did this!
Oh, I'm done. You know what,
I did all of this. This was all me!
This is ridiculous!
- We barely got to know her.
I feel so bad for them, but what do you say to someone that's suffered this kind of loss?
I mean, it's kind of on them for not checking the voltage on a machine that has a built in air-fryer.
Don't blame the victim, Amy.
Okay, guys, look. I know this is sad, but maybe everything happens for a reason.
What reason could there possibly be for the pain I'm feeling?
Look, I probably shouldn't be telling you this because I know you'll abuse it, but when there's no third machine, you can come back here and do this.
Everything happens for a reason.
Peralta! You have to see this.
Guy got brought in this morning.
Look what we found on him.
Yeah, I get it, Rosa.
Every perp in the city is invited and I'm not.
But I... wait a minute, why is my name on this?
'Cause you're coming to the wedding, baby!
What's going on?
I arrested your best man.
Just like I wanted you to.
I was putting on a show in front of Trudy.
What?
Katherine, my fiancée, doesn't want any of my crook friends coming to the wedding.
She's a federal judge, how would that look?
Okay, but couldn't you just tell them they're not invited?
Eh... that's an uncomfortable conversation to have.
It was much easier this way.
Oh, my God.
You wanted me to find that invitation.
Mm-hmm.
You knew I would never go on a trip with a bunch of crooks unless I felt unwanted.
Classic negging.
I bet you planned to have your bachelor party at that hotel because you knew the oligarch was staying there.
Hell, yeah, otherwise I would've got an Airbnb.
And as soon as your friends committed a crime, you banked on me needing to arrest them.
Damn right. You're the most consistent person in my life, Peralta.
I can always count on you.
But, there is one detail you missed.
You never saw what I was painting on the inside of my mug at the pottery place.
"Will you be my best man"?
Judy, is this for real?
It ain't fiction....
