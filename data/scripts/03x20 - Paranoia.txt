Listen up, everyone. While Captain Holt's out of town at his conference, I'm in charge, which means, Jake, I order you to throw out that gingerbread house.
It's from Christmas.
Fine. But you're gonna be leaving a lot of ants with no home.
Check it out, losers. Guess who got their dealer!
Nice! How'd it go down?
We chased him through a subway tunnel, back up through the storm drain, Adrian and I got engaged, and then we busted him with a half kilo of coke in his sock.
Wait, wait, wait.
What'd you just say?
It was in his sock.
These dummies, they never think we're gonna check their socks.
No, before that, weirdo. The getting engaged part?
Oh, yeah. We got engaged.
Engaged engaged?
Yeah.
As in, to be wed?
Yeah.
Seriously?
Together: Yeah.
Amazing! We wants deets.
Tell us everything!
I don't want to toot my own horn or anything, but it was super romantic.

Jake, can I talk to you about my wedding for a second?
Need help choosing a dress?
Big puffy bow in the back, can't go wrong.
No to all of that.
Look, Adrian is about to ask you to be his best man.
I need you to say yes and I need you to act surprised.
No problem. Check this out.
[stammering?] What? What?
Best... best man?
All right, I'll work on it.
Okay.
Sarge does not approve of the wedding, and honestly, it is killing me.
I'm sure you're just reading into it.
No.
What are you doing?
Pimento is nuts!
Ah, so not reading into it at all.
He thinks we're rushing into things, but we're not.
I love Adrian.
Every time I see him, my heart just explodes.
Wow, that's, like, some Lionel Ritchie-grade love stuff.
Anyway, I think Sarge would like him if he actually got to know him, so during the bachelor party, I need you to show him the real Adrian.
Rosa Diaz, I promise you this.
I will make sure Sarge loves him.
Great. Crap, here comes Adrian.
You never saw me.
All right.
Act surprised.
Hey, Jake, come here. I got a question for you.
[coughs] Sure.
Oh, that's very close for a question.
Jake Peralta, will you do me the honor of being my best man?
Best man?
Adrian, this is all so sudden!
Rosa told you?
Yeah.
But I would be honored.
Thank God.
I'm gonna kiss you now.
Oh, you don't have to.
Already did it.
That seals it.
So who you thinking about inviting to the bachelor party?
Maybe, like, Terry, or, I don't know, Terry's great.
Or probably Terry is available, we could ask him.
Sure, nah, I was thinking all the guys from work.
Except Chuck. Rosa called dibs on him.
Maid of honor? Yes, a million times, yes!
[gasps] It would be an honor.
Oh, my God, that's why they call it that.
Great, but I specifically said, "co-maid-of-honor," because I am also asking Amy and Gina.
I guess that's okay, if you want to water down your Charles Boyle with a couple of ice cubes.
Count me in as long as I get eight plus-ones.
Guys, focus. We need to start planning.
So when's the wedding?
Next summer, next fall, next winter?
Next week.
Next what?
Next week?
That is not enough time to plan a bridal shower, an engagement brunch, a papier-mâché sculpture of you two kissing.
Don't worry about that stuff.
The one dumb wedding thing I've always wanted was a bachelorette party.
Ah, so, cool, cool, cool.
All the pressure's on that one event, cool, cool, very cool.
Super excited for the big night.
Well, I'm happy she's excited.
I'm not sleeping for the next 24 hours.
Amen, sister. Amen.
All right, gents, Pimento's bachelor party is tomorrow night.
I've gotten us a party bus, reservations at a delightful steakhouse, and a DVD copy of "American Beauty" to watch at midnight.
That last thing was his only request.
I'm not sure if it's his favorite movie or if he's just never seen it.
I'm surprised he didn't want us all to get drunk and slash each other with machetes.
He's not exactly stable.
Die, bug!
[shouting]
Oh, no, he's dead. Oh, what have I done?
That was 18 days ago.
He's getting saner by the minute.
In a month, he'll basically just be Frasier.
Don't use Frasier's name in vain.
Copy that.
Yeah, Sarge.
If Jake wants to pay for us to have a fun night out, let's not stop him.
I'm not paying for it. We're splitting it.
Well, then, I'm with Terry. This wedding's a sham.
I'm looking out for Rosa, like I'd look out for anyone in my squad.
I get it, but you're just saying that 'cause you don't know the real Adrian.
And this bachelor party is gonna change all that.
We're gonna eat steaks, we're gonna smoke cigars.
We're gonna look at naked ladies.
No, Hitchcock, we're keeping it classy.
Right, just their boobs.
No, no boobs.
Look, Sarge, Rosa loves him.
Will you at least promise me you'll keep an open mind?
Fine, mind open.
But for the record, I think they're making a mistake, and this whole thing is gonna blow up.
Fun attitude. Save it for the party bus.
Rosa, we could really use your input on the bachelorette party.
See, we all have different ideas and no one is compromising.
I would compromise, but I refuse to not do mine.
Whose idea is best?
Excellent question.
Here's a rundown of mine, the "elevator pitch," if you will.
Has this ever happened to you?
You show up at a bachelorette party...
Ding, the elevator doors closed.
No one can hear you. We cannot hear you.
Now before I tell you my idea, are you allergic to dolphins?
Why don't we just do all three parties?
Oh, and then you pick your favorite at the end.
I.E., mine.
Sounds good.
Sounds great.
May the best maid win.
[hip-hop music playing]
Wow, how cool is this?
A TV on a bus? I never thought I'd see that.
Where's the groom already?
Who doesn't show up on time for their own party?
You mean, besides Gina?
Every year without fail. Yeah.
Look, you said you'd keep an open mind for Pimento.
He'll show. Just give him a shot.
Is everybody comfortable back there?
Does anybody need any... aah!
Sir, are you okay?
Hello?
We need to go now! [engine turns over]
Okay, just keep that mind open.
I'm sure there's a perfectly stable explanation for this.
Someone's trying to kill me!
Mind closed, Jake! Mind closed.
[tires squealing]
Yep.
Look, I know you're upset because Pimento seems a little amped up...
We were going 90 with the headlights off!
But please just give him a chance to explain before getting all angry and yelling, "Hey, man!"
Hey, man! What the hell were you doing?
Great, Sarge, can I just talk to you outside for one moment?
BRB. BRB. BRB.
Sarge, he's a good cop.
IF you ask him in a supportive, non-confrontational manner, he'll give you a calm, logical answer.
Fine.
Why do you want to know?
Who are you working for?
I will cut you, little man.
Cool. Hey, uh, Adrian?
Can I borrow you for one sec?
Look, we're all on your side here, Pimento.
We all want to believe that you're about to be murdered.
Thanks, man.
But you gotta lay out some facts and you gotta do it calmly.
Okay, here's everything I know.
It all started...
Jake, a word, please.
What?
I don't know.
Everybody else got to go outside.
Get back on the bus!
Sorry. Adrian, you were saying?
Someone's been following me for two days.
White guy, svelte, thick brown hair, piercing blue eyes.
I don't know, I guess you'd consider him classically handsome.
Is that weird to say?
No.
I mean, is it? No, I don't think so.
Anyway, this morning I turned the tables, followed him home.
We need to go there now, so we can get the drop on him.
Smart, sane, rational. Sarge, what do you think?
Fine, we can go.
But only to prove he's making this all up.
Okay, okay.
The important thing is, you agreed we can go and you and Pimento are best friends now.
Let's do it!
All right, who's up first?
Party number one will be brought to you by Gina Linetti.
And good times.
Where exactly are these good times?
Because so far, the first six seconds of your party are a big old snooze.
Tonight we will be attending my nephew Anthony's 13th birthday party.
Sounds awful. Teenage boys are the worst.
But shooting them with paintballs in the behind is the best, which is what we're gonna do.
It's a paintball party.
Nice.
Let's go shoot my nephew.
Gina, do you have any idea what you're getting into?
We play in a league.
A league.
Ow!
Oops.

Ow!

There he is!

I got him down!
I got him down! Somebody check his pockets!

A gun and a picture of Pimento.
What do you have to say now?
I guess someone's trying to kill him.
That's right! In your face!
Someone's trying to kill him! Whoo!
I mean, a man's life is in danger.
Probably shouldn't be so pumped.
Look, I'm sorry I doubted you.
I'm also sorry that someone's trying to kill you, but I can really only take ownership for the first part.
It's okay, Sarge.
I would've doubted me too.
I mean, you guys probably haven't noticed anything, but I've been acting pretty unstable lately.
Well, personally, I think I also deserve an apology.
No? Okay, that's totally cool.
So what's our plan?
Okay.
I'm gonna make this guy talk.
Okay, all I need is a car battery, jumper cables, and unfettered access to his nibs.
As much as I'd like to see that, I think you might be a little too close to this.
Maybe I should ask the questions.
Hey, Jackie, if you're asking the waiter questions, find out when the mashed potatoes are coming.
He's not a real waiter, man!
Hang on, we don't know that for sure.
Are you a waiter as well?
Mm-mm.
No.
Yeah, Terry was right.
Yeah.
So, you had a picture of my friend and a loaded gun.
Can't wait to hear what crazy story you tell to justify that.
I'm a contract killer who was hired to kill Adrian Pimento.
Oh.
That went much easier than I was expecting.
Still gonna brag.

Then we meet up and I get the money.
Interesting.
So he has no clue what you look like.
