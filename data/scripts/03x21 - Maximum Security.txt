Ka-blamo, scrubs.
I nailed it.
I solved Captain Holt's brain teaser and found the location of our secret meeting.
The answer? The broom closet.
In your face.
In whose face now?
Yours.
Gina and I have been here 20 minutes.
Though my presence is not puzzle-related.
I just followed Terry into a dark closet.
Hey.
You solved the puzzle before me.
Nerds.
[scoffs] They solved it first.
They're the nerds. I'm cool like you.
Wait. Where's Captain Holt? Where's Amy?
Yeah, she should be the first one here.
Doesn't she go to, like, an adult puzzle camp every summer?
Yes, but please don't bring that up.
I've been throwing out her mailers.
Guys, if those two aren't here, I'm thinking we must be in the wrong place.
No, trust me, we're definitely in the right place.
I'm 100% sure about this.
Well, guess who solved the puzzle?
Who?
We did.
Oh, we did?
Yeah, we're in the wrong place.
[upbeat music]
♪ ♪
Thank you for all finally showing up.
Let's recap. As you know, Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis put out a hit on Adrian Pimento, which the mob believes succeeded.
For his safety Pimento has gone off the grid.
Remember, the only people we can trust with this information are in this room.
And Genevieve. We can trust Genevieve.
We share a life. I tell her everything.
Fine, the people in this room, and Genevieve.
Genevieve's mom also knows, but she's in a coma, dead any second, we're good.
Okay.
Unfortunately, we can't just arrest Figgis, because he has a man inside the FBI.
The good news is, we have a lead that's gonna break this case wide open: Maura Figgis, Jimmy's sister.
She's currently serving in a maximum security prison in Texas.
A white woman in prison, in Texas?
[scoffs] She must be bad.
She murdered three people, and she knows Figgis's operation, so we're sending a detective in undercover as an inmate to get close to her.
Yeah, and guys, this isn't one of those women's prisons that we've all seen being all sexy on late-night cable.
You know, with the ladies touching each other's bits, and there's kind of some lame jazz playing.
When these chicks fight, it's for real.
So be mature.
Peralta is gross, but correct.
Mm.
This facility is a violent place filled with hardened criminals We need to send someone who can blend in.
Sir, I would be honored to take on this challenging assignment.
[laughter]
Why is everyone laughing?
I can be a badass.
You're raising your hand right now.
We're in a meeting.
I just assumed Diaz would be the prisoner.
Nothing personal, it's just, you know... she's terrifying.
Thank you, Sir.
Mm-hmm.
Dismissed.
Hey, that was crazy, right? I mean, I can be scary.
Oh, yeah. I watch "Jeopardy" with you and you're a straight-up psycho.
Aww. Thanks, babe.
I'll take "Awesome Girlfriends" for 500, Alex.
I know you're being sweet, but don't disparage "Jeopardy."
Okay.
[classical music playing]
All right, listen up.
[groans]
You're not gonna try to convince us Mahler was the original punk rocker again, are you?
No, the music is a classic counter-espionage maneuver.
I don't want to be overheard.
But, since you mention it, Mahler was one in-your-face bad boy.
Right, um, so, what's going on, sir?
Oh, I have a plan to draw out Figgis's man in the FBI: Throw a funeral for Pimento.
Now, before we, quote, unquote, bury Pimento, we need to, quote, unquote, open an investigation, find a, quote, unquote, corpse, and obtain a, quote, unquote, death certificate.
Kind of feel like you could have just used "air quotes."
I can also wear short pants and drink for a jug that says "XXX."
Fake funeral's a good idea, sir, but where are we gonna find a corpse?
We don't need one.
We just need pictures for the case file.
If I may, imagine Pimento's dirty, pale body being pulled out of a manhole after a couple days' sewer bloat.
Mm.
Now squint your eyes... and look at Hitchcock.
Oh, yes.
I believe we've found our corpse.
You positively glow.
How do you feel? Great.
I could smother somebody in their sleep with this thing.
Pregnancy's dope.
Whoa, bup, bup, bup.
That big old womb is not a weapon, okay?
It's just an excuse to talk to your doctors, AKA, Charles and me, in private.
If you need to chat, just schedule an appointment with Brent Kennedy, ob-gyn.
And I'm Glen Kennedy, ob-gyn.
We're twins, like "Property Brothers," but for gynecology.
No, I said no to that idea.
[sighs]
You are Isaac Schwartz, my older Jewish mentor, and you are Isabel Cortez.
You're in for stabbing a man on the subway 46 times in the trachea.
Tight.
The pregnancy stuff is my area of expertise.
Since Genevieve started fertility treatments, it's all we talk about.
Now... show me your waddle.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay, okay.
[with Cockney accent] Nice.
Good work.
You really look like a corpse.
And I'm not even wearing makeup.
[camera clicks]
Time of death: 8:26 p.m.
Now all I have to do is sign as the coroner.
You are disturbingly good at this.
I grew up forging report cards.
If people knew how smart I was, it would have been harder to control them.
Now all we need is the death certificate officially notarized.
You want me to break the sacred oath I took to become a notary?
It's not a problem. 'Cause... I'm a badass.
Just like Rosa.
So...
I am going to stamp this, and... violate my oath...
You can keep talking, but we're done here.
[thuds]
Adrian Pimento is officially deceased.
Excellent.
All this sneaking around is exhilarating.
I can feel the adrenaline coursing through my body.
Coursing.

Isabel Cortez, welcome to your new home.
This is gonna be fun.
Really?
What are your weekends like, Diaz?
All right. It's time, Detective.
Don't forget, you're seven months pregnant.
Your cervix is ripening as we speak.
Mention my cervix again and I will rip your throat out.
I don't understand. You don't like it when he talks about your cervix ripening?
Okay, have fun.
They grow up so fast.
[buzzer sounds]
Okay, fresh meat.
You're being transferred here because you made trouble in your last prison.
That won't fly here. Stay in your lane.
Hey. You're that cop who arrested me three years ago in Brooklyn.
Uh...
Amy Santiago, you're going to prison.
I don't know. Is anyone gonna buy it?
I mean, do I look pregnant?
I mean...
I guess I can see it.
I think it's amazing.
Oh, Jake and Amy and baby makes three.
I don't know if I believe in God, but I have prayed for this.
That is psychotic.
[chuckles]
All right, Ames, let's go over your cover story again.
[sighs] Okay.
My name is Isabel Cortez, I'm in for murder, 'cause some perv on the subway tried to touch me and I was like, "Did someone order a tracheotomy?"
Okay, I think that's a little too technical.
We need to work on your tough talk.
So, what are you in for, Cortez?
None of your damn business.
Nice. Keep going with that.
I'm gonna split you like a sundae with Grandpa... bitch.
Okay. Okay.
The "bitch" part was great. Yeah.
Although, mean threats generally don't involve having desserts with your grandparents.
So, just try again.
Keep telling me what to do and I'll stab your face off.
Hell yes!
Damn!
Like that.
Okay, now, here's the plan.
Instead of you approaching Maura, we're gonna get her to come to you.
Yeah, try and spread the word that you've got a connect on the outside that gives you access to contrabands: cigarettes, burner phones...
Pornography.
Amy, women don't watch...
They do.
Mm.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, wow.
Mm-hmm.
Huh.
Well, that's an exciting revelation for me.
Mm-hmm.
Huh.
Sorry prison didn't work out.
Eh, I'll find another use for that shiv.
Also, I'm sorry about Pimento.
I mean, I know how hard it is to have a fiancé disappear because the mob and the FBI want 'em dead.
I mean...
Actually, I can't relate at all.
It's the saddest story I ever heard.
Look, you wanna talk, I'm a good listener.
There's nothing to be sad about.
Pimento's gonna come back, we're gonna get married and we're gonna have s*x on Figgis's grave just like we planned.
Cool honeymoon.
Mm-hmm.
Well, since you're not in prison, you can help us.
We're gonna throw a fake funeral to draw out our FBI guy.
Good plan.
I always thought it would be funny to kill somebody at a funeral. [laughs]
Also, you're gonna have to play the grieving fiancé.
What?
So you may not be sad, but you're gonna need to look it.
Fine.
Boo hoo.
Maybe we'll get you a real thick veil or something.

It's okay, Jake. I wish we'd talk like that more.
No.

Passed around the system.
Never stayed anywhere long enough to call it home.
Ooh, that's a good answer.
Yeah, that one was mine.
I speak the language of the streets.
It was actually from "Girl, Interrupted."
Yeah.
Oh, it's happening. She dropped the contraband.
Hey, where you get that crap?
I got a hookup on the outside, so I can get anything for a price.
This is yours... if you can get the word out about my store.
Okay, I can do that.
Cellie for my cellie.
Oh, no... wordplay? Abort.
Cellie? I get it. Funny.
Oh, it actually worked.
Huh.
People are really starved for entertainment in here.
Jail is hell.
Yeah.
All that we know about Figgis's man in the FBI is that he's a white male of average height and build, and according to Jake, he has a scar on his hand.
Oh, this is a long-shot, but if his name is Joe, could we call him Scar-Joe?
Scar-Joe. Never heard that before.
I like it. We'll use it.
Now, funeral assignments.
Gina and I will greet people, shaking hands and checking for the tell-tale scar.

Okay, and...
All right, sitting alone.
Bold choice, bold choice. Hmm.
Oh, here comes Maura.
Hey, Cortez.
I hear you can smuggle in crap from outside.
Noice, it's working.
That's right, baby.
What do you want?
What I want... is for you to back the hell off... because I'm the only store in this prison.
Uh-oh.
Well, I didn't see your name on the outside of the prison, unless your name is Texas State Penitentiary Comma Spring Valley Unit.
Oh, this is bad.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but she should have sat with the hot-zis.

Hey, what's going on?
I was talking to Figgis and then the guard said I had an appointment.
I'm not supposed to check in until tomorrow.
People might get suspicious.
Look, we called you in because your first contact with Figgis was a disaster.
Why? Because our smuggling plan backfired and she threatened to kill me?
Yes, every single detail of what you just said.
We need a new plan.
And I've got one.
I need to step to her.
Step to her?
Amy, this isn't "High School Musical."
Yeah, Amy, this isn't "High School Musical 2."
Yeah, and it isn't "High School Musical 3: Senior Year."
All right.
Point is, it's not a high school musical.
That's right.
I got it.
Look, Figgis is seriously dangerous, all right?
She's killed more people in prison than she did on the outside.
I know, and if I back down now she'll never respect me and we'll get nowhere with her.
Trust me, I've got this.
Okay, I can see that logic, but in the interest of keeping you as un-shanked as possible, I think maybe we need a signal in case things go south.
Ooh, I know. Scratch your butt.
No, that's no good. What if her butt itches for real?
I think I can handle it.
I've made it through 20 years of adulthood without scratching my butt in public.

Which you are nailing, by the way.

I mean, she has a full back tattoo of herself stabbing a guy.
He looks like Tom Hanks!
Yeah, and that's America's male sweetheart.
I can't believe this.
You wouldn't tell Rosa to stand down.
Well, yeah, because she's Rosa.
I mean, one time, I saw her eat a whole apple using a knife, just like in the movies.
Get over the apple thing. That was three years ago.
I know, it was just so cool.
Look, I'm your handler, all right?
You have to just trust me on this.
My job is to keep you safe. It's the right call.
Fine, I'll slow-play it.
