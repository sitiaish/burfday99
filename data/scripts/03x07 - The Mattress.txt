Hey, Jakey, the place on the corner is serving lemonade, and you get to keep the jar.
It's pretty cool.
Yes, that's very cool, Scully.
Mm-hmm.
Will you excuse me just one moment?
Oh, sure.
Guys, guys, guys!
Scully has a mason jar full of lemonade.
You called us in here to tell us that?
No, I called you in here to change your lives!
For, you see, a mere five minutes ago, Hitchcock introduced me to his new goldfish, who lives in...
[gasps]
An identical mason jar!
Oh, this isn't gonna end well.
There are two possible outcomes, and we're going to bet on which one happens first.
So, will Hitchcock put fish food in Scully's lemonade, or will Scully drink Hitchcock's goldfish?
Now, you would think that putting fish food into lemonade...
Hitchcock just drank his own fish.
What?
Nooo!

Ames, you're two minutes late.
I called all the emergency rooms.
I know.
I went home from your place to shower, and I'm so tired that I fell asleep while shaving my legs.
But we went to bed so early.
"Property Brothers" was over at 10:00.
I mean... s*x.

She's tired from all the doing it.
Who are you talking to?

Come on, man.
Yeah.
No, I was up all night because your dumb, lumpy mattress is so uncomfortable.
What? But I gave you the good lump.
Ugh, please stop talking till I finish eating my coffee.
[with British accent] Ooh, a lover's quarrel.
No, I'm just tired.
I didn't ask for part two.
Never fear, Amy, for I have the solution to all of your problems: Highly potent liquid speed.
Oh, you gonna love that stuff.
Devon, we're cops. Read the room.
But I know you'll be excited, because I busted Devon here with four vials of this, which is a new drug called...
Taxi!
You actually found some?
Yup. Your CI was right.
It's popping up on the corners.
Man, my snitches are the best.
The key is to always send them handwritten thank-you notes.
Oh. So what do you say?
Shall we take this partnership from the sheets to the streets?
Ooh, our first case as a couple.
Why not?
Hey, guys.
I just discovered a new drug too.
It's called "your relationship," and I'm high on it.
Charles, I'm gonna need you to back off, man.
Roger that.
Yeah.
All right. I'll take one.
Now, go sell your candy to everyone else, stupid.
Hey, hey, hey. You can't call a kid stupid.
What if he's really stupid?
Terry, this is Sam, my little brother from Brooklyn's Big Brothers.
I think it's funny when she calls me stupid.
No one cares, stupid.
Screw you, Rosa.
Sam's selling candy to pay for his basketball uniforms.
He's a forward. I taught him how to elbow.
Cool?
Now, go home and do all your homework, or I will end you.
Don't let Rosa fool you.
She's not that scary.
She used to do ballet.
No way.
Which gave me the physical skills I need to strangle you with my feet.
Now scram.
[sighs]
I love being a mentor.
It's called "taxi" because it's yellow, and it takes you where you need to be.
Drug dealers have gotten so creative.
It used to just be "crack," and then they'd be like, "Hey, we got a new one. What are we gonna call this?"
And they'd go, "I don't know, crank?"
This is certainly worth following up on.
Santiago, take Boyle, and work the case.
Oh, but Jake... I mean, Detective Peralta brought in the perp, so...
Good point.
Peralta and Boyle can work the case.
Actually, sir, I think we were kind of hoping we could work the case together.
Oh, are you two no longer...
Smooshing booties?
Yes, that's exactly how I was gonna finish my sentence.
Figured.
We are still dating.
It's all above board.
HR gets daily updates and are BCC'd on all our emails to each other.
That's why HR Jim keeps high-fiving me.
As a rule, I don't put couples in the field together, but you are two of my best detectives, so I will allow it.
Just don't let any personal issues distract you from your work.
You have nothing to worry about.
There's no personal issues here.
We've never even had a fight.
It's true.
Our only close call was when Jake didn't know who Will Shortz was.

This is who you want to be with?
I shouldn't get involved.
Good luck with the case.

Hello, Brian.
Coming on a little strong there, buddy... and I'm digging it.
How much to take this bad boy home?
Actually, that's one of our more reasonable models.
Oh. Holy Moses!
That is much too much money.
Well, you spent twice that for Mr. Met to come to your birthday party.
Yeah, and it was worth it.
Mr. Met used my bathroom. Number two.
That's a memory I will cherish forever.
Look, mattresses are expensive, but they're an investment.
It's gonna be in your life for a long time.
True, but it's also still just a mattress, you know?
It's a lot of money to spend on a rectangle that's filled with springs and goose hair.
You know it's feathers.
I didn't.
And it would be money well spent, because it would allow me to actually sleep in your bed.
But I already have a mattress.
It just doesn't seem worth it.
Okay, well, to me, it sounds like you're saying I'm not worth it.
So I'm gonna go sleep in my grown-up mattress that I bought this century, and you're not invited.
You know, she's right about mattresses being an investment.
Back off, Brian.
Morning.
You look well-rested.
Yes, because I slept in my own bed.

Uh, okay, now you're just being crazy.
Ugh, you're not even taking this argument seriously.
All right. You want to get serious?
How come you haven't told your mom that we're dating?
Yeah, that's right.
I saw the text she sent you about setting you up with some dude named Gary.
You read my texts?

Wow, it sounds like such a huge drag.
I guess I'm just not "worth it."
Boom... used the thing you said to me in a different argument in this argument.
I win the argument.
Oh, no, no, no. This is bad.
Well, you started it... or I did.
I can't remember at this point.

Look at the screen.
Oh, no.
For the last time, Orangina is not orange soda.
Yeah, because it's better.
Uh, okay, now you're just being crazy.
You're not even taking this...
You do have to admit, it was a pretty good point about Orangina, though.

Thank you, Santiago.
Okay.
I know you're mad, but before you say anything, yes, we screwed up.
And yes, you warned us.
And yes, I don't know where I'm going with this.
But I do know this: I have reached the end of my sentence.
Oh, my God. Did that work?
Not at all.
Oh.
I can't believe you let a personal argument derail your investigation.
I would characterize it more as a professional police disagreement.
I listened to the tape.
Oh, no.
Yeah, well, then you know that it was a straight-up crazy bitch fight.
Look; I know we screwed up the case, and I'm sorry.
But if it's any consolation, I think we also screwed up our relationship.
Peralta, have a seat.
I believe this might help.
When Kevin and I first started dating, he taught at a small college upstate.
It was two hours away by train or bus, but only 30 minutes by car.
Is this another one of your riddles?
You rode to work on his shoulders.
One set of footprints. No?
No.
Okay.
Neither of us owned a car, and I didn't want to buy one because that would mean admitting that I cared for Kevin.
He had the same fear, and so visits were rare, and I was miserable.
Then one spring day, Kevin showed up at my door having purchased Gertie.
He took the leap, and I'm so grateful that he did.
I only regret that I didn't do it first.
Do you understand?
Absolutely.
100%.
The train is your old mattress.
Yeah.
The car is your new mattress.

Kevin is you.
Mm-hmm.

She was constantly riding me about my posture and my technique and my pink hair.
Pink hair.
Never speak of that.

This is totally how I thought this Ms. Miriam thing was gonna go.
Another flawless Terry plan.
Boyle, I thought you should know.
I just got Gertie back from the garage.
She looks as good as new.
Better, even, because after 12 years, they finally got the Annie Lennox cassette out of the tape player.
Oh, I love her.
Here's a check for the full amount.
You don't owe me anything.
It was my fault, and I behaved poorly, as Gina made abundantly clear.
Oh, speaking of, you still owe me $14 for that cupcake.
Hey.
Hey.

Well, druggies are lazy?

We're screwed.
Yup.
What's the second thing?
Well, the Captain and I were jamming on some personal issues, just going back and forth.

I'm not buying any of that.
No.

Amy Santiago... I want to change mattresses for you.
That's the best thing I've ever heard.
I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.

Like, you're Orangina, and I'm orange soda.
Are you kidding?
You're Orangina.
Ugh.
Don't say that.
Look.
I was scared too.
