This installation is composed of Constantine's accounts of the first Punic War in the year 264...
Ah, yes the first pubic war, the sexiest of all wars.
Hi, Dr.
Albrin Einstibe.
I have an urgent question for you about Ancient Greece.
Shall we walk?
Of course, Doctor...
I feel like you said Einstibe?
Yes, that's correct, it's a family name.
What is going on?
Captain Holt sent me.
Just follow my lead.
Your theory is wrong.
The Greeks did not climb out of the Trojan Horse's butt.
Put this on.
A rose shearing hat, at work?
People will think I'm demented.
[whispers]
Just put it on.
Kevin, Dr.
Einstibe.
Ah, professor McGonagall.
Why is Boyle dressed as me?
Shh!
Get in.
But this cart is...

♪ ♪ Professor.
Student.
[funky music]
♪ ♪ [tires screech]
♪ ♪ Hello, Kevin.
It's me, Raymond Holt.
We need to get you to safety.
Your life is in danger.
[upbeat music]
♪ ♪ Okay, so we've secured Captain Holt's husband.
Let's discuss how to proceed.
So what you're saying is, we need to talk about Kevin.
[all boo]
I have no regrets!
Kevin is currently at the safe house with Captain Holt.
How long will he have to stay there?
My friend in the Organized Crime division says they've been building a case against Seamus Murphy for years, and they're close.
They think they'll move on him in the next month or two.
So you're saying, Kevin can wait?
[all boo]
You know what, you people are insane.
That was gold.
Okay, two months in a safe house...
that's not impossible.
It's nothing.
I once stayed in my apartment for 3 1/2 months straight.
Was that after they cancelled "Bunheads"?
Why would you bring that up?
I don't understand.
Why can't we just put Kevin into WITSEC?
The Murphys have killed three witnesses in federal protection.
Captain doesn't wanna risk it.
We'll take shifts staying with Kevin.
No, it should just be me.
Look, it's my fault that Murphy's after Kevin.
Captain Holt bailed me out, and now it's my turn to bail him out.
Plus we've got this whole tit for tat thing going, and it's my time to tit.
It's my tit turn.
My time to tit is today, Terry.
You're gonna stay locked up in a safe house, away from us for two months?
That's going to be brutal.
You just said it was nothing.
Brutal for me, Gina.
Relax, I'm still going to be able to text and chat with everyone.
It's not like I'm being totally shut off from the outside world.
Say good-bye to the outside world.
You're in the safe house now, so I'll need your phone.
Why?
Internet, cellular signals.
They're too easy to trace.
Seriously, no phone?
What am I supposed to do to pass the time?
You could learn a foreign language.
Go to hell.
The "no internet rule" was a shock to me as well.
I was hoping to salvage this time to do research on my new book.
But apparently that will not be possible.
I'm sorry, it's for your own safety.
Here, Peralta, let me give you a tour of the safe house.
This is the living room.
Oh.
Stop!
You're entering the zone of visibility.
Someone could see you through the windows.
Why don't we just close the blinds?
At mid-day?
That's far too suspicious.
Blinds will only be closed at night.
If you must go into the living room, crawl on your belly.
Observe.
Seems a little extreme.
You're right, it's extreme of me to try to prevent my husband from being shot in the face.
I'm over-doing it.
Kevin, come in here.
Take your bullet.
No, fine.
We'll stay on our bellies.
Thank you.
This is one of several designated areas where you can stand upright during the day.
You can move about freely in this square.
Wow, so we have all this room to work in?
Your hand can be seen from the living room window.
You just killed Kevin.
Raymond...
I can't hear you, Kevin.
You're dead.
He bled out in your lap.
How will you break the news to me?
Let's see.
We don't have to do this.
Ah, Detective Peralta, how are things going with Kevin, the love of my life?
Wait, why are you here at this late hour?
And whose blood is that?
Okay, I get it.
It's Kevin's?
This is devastating.
I'm inconsolable.
And I've killed myself.
Cool, well, I can see this is gonna be a fun couple of months.
Okay, we can't stream anything, but I brought my DVD collection.
Do you like Nic Cage movies?
I don't know who that is.
Only the greatest and most compelling actor of all time.
What are his movies like?
Describe them.
Okay, well, one of them is the FBI has developed face-swapping technology.
Not interested.
There's a whole plane full of convicts.
Nope.
On the back of the original Declaration of Independence, there's a hidden treasure map!
Stop.
But that's the smartest one!
Oh my God, I'm so glad Captain Holt finally agreed to let you come visit.
I missed you so much.
Me too.
Um...
is there a way we could get a bit more privacy?
Just pretend I'm not here.
God knows I am.
Okay, I think you're actually going to like this one.
Nic Cage is a chemist...
Interesting, keep going.
Who has to break into Alcatraz...
Absolutely not!
Are there no other actors?
It's Captain Holt.
Hello, Captain.
And...
you're both dead.
You didn't ask for the password.
What if I were an assassin wearing a hyper-realistic latex mask?
Or perhaps you employed "Face/Off" technology.
What?
I broke down and watched one of Peralta's action films.
I'm lying, I watched them all, including one wherein a man's head turns into a flaming skull.
"Ghost Rider", and "Ghost Rider 2." Both master-pie.
Yes, I need your help, Raymond.
Luckily, I come bearing good news.
My friend in the Organized Crime unit tells me that they're moving against Murphy tonight.
Oh, my God, really?
You're serious?
You mean to say this could be ending?
Peralta, it's happening.
It's finally happening.
Call everyone, we'll get a live feed of the raid and have a viewing party.
"Tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree, 'cause this boy's comin' home." "Con Air".
What have I become?
Oh, yes, people.
Actual real people that aren't Kevin.
Hi, I want to touch you.
Babe, you're being weird.
Right, sorry.
I forgot how to be human.
Yeah.
Oh, Charles!
Ah.
I need to hear your voice, Tell me what I've been missing at the nine-nine.
Ooh, Terry's grandma got really sick and had to spend a month in the hospital.
Oh...
that's sad.
I more meant like funny work anecdotes.
Ah, Scully sat on a cherry pie and he didn't notice for six hours.
The tin stayed on the whole time.
Now we're talking.
Did you take a picture?
Honestly, I didn't see it.
I was at Terry's grandma's funeral.
Come on.
Everyone, quiet down.
The feed is live and the raid begins in T-minus 60 seconds.
In one minute, Kevin and I will finally be able to leave this awful place.
And yet we'll never be free of the nightmares.
No, those shall haunt us for always.
Whoa, things got really intense in here, huh?
Oh, yeah, it got dark.
This place is a hell-mouth.
Cool.
Shh!
They're about to move.
Bravo team, stand by.
I love this.
I feel like Ellen watching her producers go through a haunted house.
Breach, breach!
They're in.
There's nobody here.
Uh-oh, the house is empty!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Where's Seamus?
I don't understand, what's happening?
Someone must have tipped them off.
The raid is a bust, and Murphy's still at large.
So what you're saying is...
Everyone on the ground, immediately!
[squish]
Oh no, I sat in another pie.
Damn it!
Next time, sit on a pie when we can enjoy it, Scully.
Organized Crime is hunting for Murphy, but we can't just sit back and hope they find him.
Diaz, where are you with your CI?
They said Seamus' girlfriend Nikki works in a hair salon in Bay Ridge.
Nice, classic mistress job.
Hey, my girlfriend's a hairdresser!
And you cheated on your ex-wife with her.
Checkmate.
Well played.
Okay, Nikki won't talk to cops.
So we've got to send someone in as a customer.
Get her to open up, start gossiping.
Send me.
I'm a gossip surgeon.
I can get anything out of anyone.
You can't go undercover, you're not a cop.
How am I not a cop, Terry?
'Cause I don't have a badge?
Being a cop is a state of mind.
It's definitely not.
Diaz, the mission is yours.
Great.
I love strangers touching my head.
Sorry, you don't have a choice.
Dismissed!
Actually, Sarge, I have a lead too.
I found the place that provides shredding services for Murphy's companies.
I subpoenaed those shreds.
We can piece them together.
Smart.
How many shreds are we talking?
A few.
Oh, crap.
According to Organized Crime, Murphy has gone to ground, and there are no leads.
Oh, that's great.
If he's on the run, he probably won't be worrying about Kevin.
And if you coat yourself in chum and swim with sharks, you probably won't be eaten.
Said the half-eaten chum-covered swimmer.
While Murphy is at large, he's still a threat.
So I'm going to be stuck here forever, following these over-the-top security precautions?
No.
Thank God.
The security procedures are about to become much more over-the-top.
Say good-bye to your one hour of open window time.
But sir, the stench.
It needs some way to escape.
I already feel as though I'm trapped inside of...
What are those things you're always eating?
Pizza bagels?
Pizza rolls?
No.
No.
Pizza poppers?
Pizzaritos?
No.
No.
Pizza pockets?
That's it.
How much longer will I be forced to live inside this pizza pocket?
Look, I could tell you that it'll just be a few more weeks, but you don't want me to lie to you.
Raymond, I beg of you.
Give me two hours at the library to work on my book...
just two hours.
It will make all the difference.
Yeah, I could go with him, keep him safe.
No library.
Seamus' men could be lurking in the stacks.
I find that unlikely.
I understand, but I disagree.
Well then, we are in disagreement.
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm sorry you had to witness such a vicious fight.
Oh, was that a fight?
Are you kidding?
He said "you'll have to excuse me" instead of "please excuse me." Might as well have spit in my face.
[upbeat music]
Okay, first of all, Rosa, you look amazing.
Secondly, I made an appointment at the salon with Nikki, for you, under the name Gabriella Fuentes de San Miguel Estrada.
I had fun with the name.
Clearly.
Here's the plan.
Gabriella Fuentes de San Miguel Estrada gossips about her love life.
Then, Nikki opens up about hers.
Yeah, this is the problem.
I suck at gossiping.
Which is why I brought along a specialist.
Gina will be in your ear feeding you stories.
I will be basing Gabriella on my sister's friend, Dana.
Just be warned...
Dana real sloppy.
So, Nikki, I always wanted to get my hair cut here.
Everyone says you're the best.
Oh, my God, I love your earrings.
Where did you get those hoops?
Mmm, I don't know.
Oh no, Nikki's not a talker.
We're screwed.
Don't worry angel, Gina's got this, crackety-crack.
Rosa, repeat after me and don't change a thing.
Can I tell you the craziest story?
One time I was like so drunk...
And this meathead comes up to me.
And his body is hot, but his face is like okay.
So I'm like, what?
And I was like, bitch, I'm not gonna sleep with you just because you promised to take me to the Bahamas.
Take me to the Bahamas first and then we'll see what happens, okay?
I was only with him because he drove a Jaguar.
Turns out it was a Mercury with a Thundercat taped to the hood.
And that relationship lasted for three months.
I don't know why we broke up.
I guess we just grew apart when he went to prison for life.
I hear that.
The guy I'm seeing is into some shady stuff.
Right?
There it is, the breakthrough.
Follow up, follow up!
So, how'd you guys meet?
That's a funny story, for next time.
You're all done, and you look hot, girl.
No, no, she was opening up.
Rosa, figure out a way to stay in that chair.
Hey, Nikki, I was just wondering.
How do you think I would look...
[voice strains]
as a blonde?
Like a Danielle Steele novel.
Good oranges, nice and dry.
Not at all ripe.
Fascinating.
My orange is beginning to rot.
That happens when you leave an orange sitting around for too long and refuse to even let that orange go to a library for two hours so it can feel like a real orange again.
You know what really causes an orange to go bad?
Getting shot.
Have you seen what a bullet does to an orange?
I shot a watermelon once.
It's exactly what you want it to be.
I miss Amy.
You think I enjoy doing this?
I assure you, I do not.
I'm simply trying to keep my husband alive.
Well, you may not have a husband when all of this is over.
You're not going to die, Kevin.
That's not what I meant.
I'm leaving.
This is an absurd conversation, and you're being ridiculous.
[door opens, closes]
You know what, screw this.
We need a break.
I'm a cop, I can protect us.
We're going to the library.
These two oranges are stepping out.
Oh, damn it, peeling out.
It was right there!
Okay, Captain Holt has back-to-back meetings at One Police Plaza today, which means we have a four-hour window before he checks on any of the security feeds.
But going out into public is a huge risk, so maybe let's go over some self-defense techniques.
[gasps]
[chokes]
Usually, you warn somebody before you do that.
Raymond told me that the element of surprise was crucial.
Cool.
[coughs]
So he's a great teacher.
But I will say this.
If you're going to do a throat punch, it is key that you say something cool afterwards like, "choke on that." But they're not choking.
They're experiencing airway trauma.
Ooh, how about, "Better get some corticosteroids to treat that laryngeal fracture." Okay, yeah, that's very informative and quite polite.
[ahem]
But maybe add a "dirtbag" on the end?
But a dirtbag is a useful part of a vacuum.
I don't see how it's an insult.
All right, you know, puncher's choice.
Moving on, we're going to need disguises.
And since we're going to a public library, the best way to fit in is as... Scholars.
Weird perverts.
Yes, weird perverts is far better.
Far better.

Okay, I've got three words.

The trackers are in your shoes, underwear, and wallet.
I also braided one into your hair.

In my tangle?
You put my husband at risk, and for what?
Because you felt a little cooped up?
That's not it.
You could have cost him his life.
What life, Raymond?
I spend every day lying on the floor of that house talking with Jake about popular culture.
Do you know what it means to "clap back", Raymond?
Be-cause-I-do.
Enough.
We have to get back to the safe house immediately.
Let's go.
And if you're gonna be a pervert, Kevin, adjust yourself as you walk.
