This year's Halloween Heist is a three-way tiebreaker to determine the champion of champions.
We'll be playing for this: a plaque that reads, "The Ultimate Detective/Genius."
You and Santiago should quit now.
I'm going to stomp on your dreams.
It's fun to see you so passionate.
I will slit you both open from mouth to anus and wear you like jackets.
Wow. Is it weird that that turned me on a little bit?
Doesn't matter.
But let's move on.
The plaque will be held in this.
Is that my childhood caboodle?
It most certainly is, but don't worry.
I removed the scrunchies, old report cards, and photos of young Al Gore.
I'm better-looking than him anyway.
We're talking a young Al Gore?
[both laugh]
Peralta, you do make me laugh.
Okay, stings a little bit.
It will be secured with this brand-new lock.
Hitchcock, if you would do the honors.
There you are.
You can have that back in three...
Nope, don't ever need it back.
Now, then, locking the caboodle.
The "ca-boo-dale" will be placed in the center of the bullpen.
Right, and what is the name of the store at the mall that sells the sticky pastries?
You mean the "See-nay-bone"?
Yeah, that was it. Thanks. Continue.
Whoever possesses the plaque at sunup wins.
Now let's pick teams.
I've got a ton of work.
You can just leave me out this year.
Interesting. Interesting.
Oh, Terry, Terry, Terry.

How naive do you think we are?
You're "not participating" so you can sneak under our noses and steal a victory, like Santiago did last year.
I'm going to my desk.
Heists are dumb.
If you have nothing to hide, then I'm sure you won't mind me asking Hitchcock and Scully to keep an eye on you.
Whatever.
My eyes will be glued to that ass.
Great! It's now time to choose from the remaining players.
Amy, since you're last year's champion, you go first.
I choose Rosa.

I select Charles Boyle.

What's the matter, Peralta?
Were you expecting to have Detective Boyle on your team?
Have I thrown a wrench into your plans?
Absolutely not.

I had absolutely nothing planned for Charles.
