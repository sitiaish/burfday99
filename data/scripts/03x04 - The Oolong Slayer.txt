Just some old lady has a missing torso that we can't find.

It's because I got a bet going with the captain of the A4 to see whose squad can solve the most cases.
Winner gets to choose a tattoo for the loser, and guess what I'm getting him.

Man, you're really stupid in the morning, aren't you?
Captain, we all want you to win that bet, but do you think maybe we could keep a few real cases?
Look, I'm gonna keep it real simple for you.

Perp came in through the back window, set up the living room to look like a kid's tea party, didn't steal anything.

The perp wasn't there to take anything... except lives.
Sorry, I always wanted to say that.

Chief Garmin set up a task force to find the guy and turned up nothing, and most importantly, the vulture's orders were only misdemeanors, wieners.
Why do you follow people's directions when you could literally pick them up and throw them out the window?

If I recall correctly, the Oolong Slayer last struck five years ago.
He left behind no DNA or fingerprints, but he did leave his calling card, a tea bag in his victim's mouth.
Yeah, how cool... I mean awful... is that?
Very cool... I mean awful.
What's our strategy?
One, reexamine all the task force's files, two, check all B and Es against the slayer's MO, and three, think of something supercool to say when we arrest him.
My leading contender?
"You're going to jail for oolong time."
Jake, that's really good.
Right?
Let's not overlook the fact that he turned his crime scenes into tea parties for dollies.
Which suggests preadolescent trauma leading to a pattern of criminality that probably began as a juvenile.
I'm taking an abnormal psych class, and everyone in it is obsessed with me.
You look into the B and Es and I'll check out the juvie angle.
Now, before we begin in earnest, I'd like to propose a toast.
